## ROCm 7.2.0

See the [ROCm 7.2.0 release notes](https://rocm-stg.amd.com/en/latest/about/release-notes.html#rocm-7-2-0-release-notes)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (26.2.1)

#### Added

- GPU and baseboard temperature options to `amd-smi monitor` CLI.
  - `amd-smi monitor --gpu-board-temps` for GPU board temperature sensors.
  - `amd-smi monitor --base-board-temps` for base board temperature sensors.

(amdsmi-npm-changelog)=
- New Node Power Management (NPM) APIs and CLI options for node monitoring.
  - C++ API functions:
    - `amdsmi_get_node_handle()` gets the handle for a node device.
    - `amdsmi_get_npm_info()` retrieves Node Power Management information.
  - C++ types:
    - `amdsmi_npm_status_t` indicates whether NPM is enabled or disabled.
    - `amdsmi_npm_info_t` contains the status and node-level power limit in watts.
  - Added Python API wrappers for new node device functions.
  - Added `amd-smi node` subcommand for NPM operations via CLI.
  - Currently supported for `OAM_ID 0` only.

- The following C APIs are added to `amdsmi_interface.py`:  
  - `amdsmi_get_cpu_handle()`
  - `amdsmi_get_esmi_err_msg()`
  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_event_notification()`
  - `amdsmi_get_processor_count_from_handles()`
  - `amdsmi_get_processor_handles_by_type()`
  - `amdsmi_gpu_validate_ras_eeprom()`
  - `amdsmi_init_gpu_event_notification()`
  - `amdsmi_set_gpu_event_notification_mask()`
  - `amdsmi_stop_gpu_event_notification()`
  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_busy_percent()`

- Additional return value to `amdsmi_get_xgmi_plpd()` API:  
  - The entry `policies` is added to the end of the dictionary to match API definition.
  - The entry `plpds` is marked for deprecation as it has the same information as `policies`.

- PCIe levels to `amd-smi static --bus` command.  
  - The static `--bus` option has been updated to include the range of PCIe levels that you can set for a device.
  - Levels are a 2-tuple composed of the PCIe speed and bandwidth.

- `evicted_time` metric for KFD processes.  
  - Time that queues are evicted on a GPU in milliseconds.
  - Added to CLI in `amd-smi monitor -q` and `amd-smi process`.
  - Added to C APIs and Python APIs: `amdsmi_get_gpu_process_list()`, `amdsmi_get_gpu_compute_process_info()`
, and `amdsmi_get_gpu_compute_process_info_by_pid()`.

- New VRAM types to `amdsmi_vram_type_t`.
  - `amd-smi static --vram` and `amdsmi_get_gpu_vram_info()` now support the following types: `DDR5`, `LPDDR4`, `LPDDR5`, and `HBM3E`.

- Support for PPT1 power limit information.  
  - Support has been added for querying and setting the PPT (Package Power Tracking) limits
    - There are two PPT limits. PPT0 has lower limit and tracks a filtered version of the input power. PPT1 has higher limit but tracks the raw input power. This is to catch spikes in the raw data.
  - New API added:
    - `amdsmi_get_supported_power_cap()`: Returns power cap types supported on the device (PPT0, PPT1). This will allow you to know which power cap types you can get/set.
    - Original APIs remain the same but now can get/set both PPT0 and PPT1 limits (on supported hardware): `amdsmi_get_power_cap_info()` and `amdsmi_set_power_cap()`.
  - See the Changed section for changes made to the `set` and `static` commands regarding support for PPT1.  

#### Changed

- The `amd-smi` command now shows `hsmp` rather than `amd_hsmp`.  
  - The `hsmp` driver version can be shown without the `amdgpu` version using `amd-smi version -c`.

- The `amd-smi set --power-cap` command now requires specification of the power cap type.  
  - Command now takes the form: `amd-smi set --power-cap <power-cap-type> <new-cap>`
  - Acceptable power cap types are "ppt0" and "ppt1".

- The `amd-smi reset --power-cap` command will now attempt to reset both `PPT0` and `PPT1` power caps to their default values. If a device only has `PPT0`, then only `PPT0` will be reset.  

- The `amd-smi static --limit` command now has a `PPT1` section when PPT1 is available. The `static --limit` command has been updated to include `PPT1` power limit information when available on the device.

#### Resolved Issues

- Fixed an issue where `amdsmi_get_gpu_od_volt_info()` returned a reference to a Python object. The returned dictionary was changed to return values in all fields.

#### Upcoming changes

* Composable Kernel will be adopting C++20 features in an upcoming ROCm release, updating the minimum compiler requirement to C++20. Ensure that your development environment complies with this requirement to facilitate a seamless transition.
* In an upcoming major ROCm release, Composable Kernel will transition to a header-only library. Neither ckProfiler nor the static libraries will be packaged with Composable Kernel. They will also no longer be built by default. ckProfiler can be built independently from Composable Kernel as a standalone binary, and the static Composable Kernel libraries can be built from source.

### **HIP** (7.2.0)

     - `HIP_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_LEGACY_STREAM`
     - `HIP_GET_PROC_ADDRESS_PER_THREAD_DEFAULT_STREAM`

#### Optimized

* Graph node scaling:
    -  HIP runtime implements an optimized doorbell ring mechanism for certain topologies of graph execution. It enables efficient batching of graph nodes.
    - The enhancement provides better alignment with CUDA Graph optimizations.
    - HIP also adds a new performance test for HIP graphs with programmable topologies to measure graph performance across different structures. 
    - The test evaluates graph instantiation time, first launch time, repeat launch times, and end-to-end execution for various graph topologies. 
    - The test implements comprehensive timing measurements including CPU overhead and device execution time.
* Back memory set (memset) optimization:
    - HIP runtime now implements a back memory set (memset) optimization to improve how memset nodes are processed during graph execution. 
    - The enhancement specifically handles varying number of Architected Queue Language (AQL) packets for memset graph node due to graph node set params for AQL batch submission approach.
* Async handler performance improvement:
    - HIP runtime has removed the lock contention in async handler enqueue path.

### **rocRAND** (4.2.0)

#### Added

* Added a new CMake option `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIB` to allow tests to be built from `ROCm` libraries provided by the system.
* Experimental SPIR-V support.

#### Changed

* The `launch` method in `host_system` and `device_system`, so that kernels with all supported arches can be compiled with correct configuration during host pass. All generators are updated accordingly for support of SPIR-V. To invoke SPIR-V, it should be built with `-DAMDGPU_TARGETS=amdgcnspirv`.

#### Removed

* For performance reasons,  the `mrg31k3p_state`, `mrg32k3a_state`, `xorwow_state` and `philox4x32_10_state` states no longer use the  `boxmuller_float_state` and `boxmuller_double_state` states, and the `boxmuller_float` and `boxmuller_double` variables are set with `NaN` as default values.


### **rocSHMEM** (3.2.0)

#### Added
* The GDA conduit for AMD Pensando IONIC.

#### Changed

   * fetching atomics `rocshmem_<TYPE>_fetch_<op>`
   * collective APIs
* The following APIs now have an implementation for the IPC conduit:
   * `rocshmem_<TYPE>_atomic_{and,or,xor,swap}`
   * `rocshmem_<TYPE>_atomic_fetch_{and,or,xor,swap}`

### **rocSOLVER** (3.32.0)

#### Optimized

* Improved the performance of LARFB and downstream functions such as GEQRF and ORMTR.

### **rocSPARSE** (4.2.0)

#### Added

* NNZ split algorithm `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_nnzsplit` to `rocsparse_spmv`. This algorithm might be superior to the existing adaptive algorithm `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_adaptive` when running the computation a small number of times because it avoids paying the analysis cost of the adaptive algorithm.

#### Changed

* rocBLAS is a requirement when it's requested when building from source. Previously, rocBLAS was not used if it could not be found. To opt out of using rocBLAS when building from source, use the `--no-rocblas` option with the `install.sh` or `rmake.py` build scripts.

#### Optimized
* Significantly improved the `rocsparse_sddmm` routine when using CSR format, especially as the number of columns in the dense `A` matrix (or rows in the dense `B` matrix) increases.
* Improved the user documentation.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed the `rmake.py` build script to properly handle `auto` and all options when selecting offload targets.
* Fixed an issue when building rocSPARSE with the install script on some operating systems.
* Fixed `std::fma` casting in host routines to properly deduce types. This could have previously caused compilation failures when building from source.

### **rocThrust** (4.2.0)

#### Added

* `thrust::unique_ptr` - a smart pointer for managing device memory with automatic cleanup.
* A new cmake option, `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS`. When rocThrust is built with this option enabled, the `--offload-compress` switch is passed to the compiler. This causes the compiler to compress the binary that it generates. Compression can be useful when compiling for a large number of targets, because it often results in a larger binary. Without compression, in some cases, the generated binary may become so large symbols are placed out of range, resulting in linking errors. The new `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` option is set to `ON` by default.
* Experimental SPIR-V support.

### **rocWMMA** (2.2.0)

#### Added

* Sample `perf_i8gemm` to demonstrate `int8_t` as matrix input data type.
* Support for the gfx1150 target.

#### Changed

* Removed unnecessary const keyword to avoid compiler warnings.
* rocWMMA has been moved into the new rocm-libraries "monorepo" repository {fab}`github` [rocm-libraries](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries). This repository consolidates a number of separate ROCm libraries and shared components.
  * The repository migration requires a few changes to the CMake configuration of rocWMMA.
  * The repository migration required the GTest dependency to be updated to v1.16.0.

#### Resolved issues

* Skip invalid test configurations when using 'register file' LDS mapping.
* Ensured transform functions in samples are only available on the device.

### **RPP** (2.2.0)

#### Added

* Pinned buffer API support for HOST and HIP.

#### Changed

* AMDClag++ compiler has moved to `${ROCM_PATH}/lib/llvm/bin`.

#### Removed

* The `copy_param_float()` and `copy_param_uint()` mem copy helper functions have been removed as buffers now consistently use pinned/HIP memory.

#### Resolved issues
* Test Suite - Error Code Capture updates.

## ROCm 7.1.1

See the [ROCm 7.1.1 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-7.1.1/about/release-notes.html#rocm-7-1-1-release-notes)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (26.2.0)

#### Added

- Caching for repeated ASIC information calls.  
  - The cache added to `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info` improves performance by avoiding redundant hardware queries.
  - The cache stores ASIC info for each GPU device with a configurable duration, defaulting to 10 seconds. Use the `AMDSMI_ASIC_INFO_CACHE_MS` environment variable for cache duration configuration for `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info` API calls.

- Support for GPU partition metrics.
  - Provides support for `xcp_metrics` v1.0 and extends support for v1.1 (dynamic metrics).
  - Added `amdsmi_get_gpu_partition_metrics_info`, which provides per XCP (partition) metrics.

- Support for displaying newer VRAM memory types in `amd-smi static --vram`.
  - The `amdsmi_get_gpu_vram_info()` API now supports detecting DDR5, LPDDR4, LPDDR5, and HBM3E memory types.

#### Changed

- Updated `amd-smi static --numa` socket affinity data structure. It now displays CPU affinity information in both hexadecimal bitmask format and expanded CPU core ranges, replacing the previous simplified socket enumeration approach.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed incorrect topology weight calculations.  
  - Out-of-bound writes caused corruption in the weights field.

- Fixed `amd-smi event` not respecting the Linux timeout command.  

- Fixed an issue where `amdsmi_get_power_info` returned `AMDSMI_STATUS_API_FAILED`.  
  - VMs were incorrectly reporting `AMDSMI_STATUS_API_FAILED` when unable to get the power cap within the `amdsmi_get_power_info`.
  - The API now returns `N/A` or `UINT_MAX` for values that can't be retrieved, instead of failing.

- Fixed output for `amd-smi xgmi -l --json`.

```

### **Composable Kernel** (1.1.0)

#### Upcoming changes

* Composable Kernel will adopt C++20 features in an upcoming ROCm release, updating the minimum compiler requirement to C++20. Ensure that your development environment meets this requirement to facilitate a seamless transition.
  
### **HIP** (7.1.1)

#### Added

* Support for the flag `hipHostRegisterIoMemory` in `hipHostRegister`, used to register I/O memory with HIP runtime so the GPU can access it.

#### Resolved issues

* Incorrect Compute Unit (CU) mask in logging. HIP runtime now correctly sets the field width for the output print operation. When logging is enabled via the environment variable `AMD_LOG_LEVEL`, the runtime logs the accurate CU mask.
* A segmentation fault occurred when the dynamic queue management mechanism was enabled. HIP runtime now ensures GPU queues aren't `NULL` during marker submission, preventing crashes and improving robustness.
* An error encountered on HIP tear-down after device reset in certain applications due to accessing stale memory objects. HIP runtime now properly releases memory associated with host calls, ensuring reliable device resets.
* A race condition occurred in certain graph-related applications when pending asynchronous signal handlers referenced device memory that had already been released, leading to memory corruption. HIP runtime now uses a reference counting strategy to manage access to device objects in asynchronous event handlers, ensuring safe and reliable memory usage.

### **MIGraphX** (2.14.0)

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an error that resulted when running `make check` on systems running on a gfx1201 GPU.

### **RCCL** (2.27.7)

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed a single-node data corruption issue in MSCCL on the AMD Instinct MI350X and MI355X GPUs for the LL protocol. This previously affected about two percent of the runs for single-node `AllReduce` with inputs smaller than 512 KiB.

### **rocBLAS** (5.1.1)

#### Changed
  * By default, rocBLAS will not use stream order allocation for its internal workspace. To enable this behavior, set the `ROCBLAS_STREAM_ORDER_ALLOC` environment variable.

### **ROCm Bandwidth Test** (2.6.0)

#### Resolved issues

- Test failure with error message `Cannot make canonical path`.
- Healthcheck test failure with seg fault on gfx942.
- Segmentation fault observed in `schmoo` and `one2all` when executed on `sgpu` setup.

#### Known issues

- `rocm-bandwidth-test` folder fails to be removed after driver uninstallation:
    * After running `amdgpu-uninstall`, the `rocm-bandwidth-test` folder and package are still present.
    * Workaround: Remove the package manually using: 
    ```
    sudo apt-get remove -y rocm-bandwidth-test
    ```

### **ROCm Compute Profiler** (3.3.1)

#### Added

* Support for PC sampling of multi-kernel applications.
  * PC Sampling output instructions are displayed with the name of the kernel to which the individual instruction belongs.
  * Single kernel selection is supported so that the PC samples of the selected kernel can be displayed.

#### Changed

* Roofline analysis now runs on GPU 0 by default instead of all GPUs.

#### Optimized

* Improved roofline benchmarking by updating the `flops_benchmark` calculation.

* Improved standalone roofline plots in profile mode (PDF output) and analyze mode (CLI and GUI visual plots):
  * Fixed the peak MFMA/VALU lines being cut off.
  * Cleaned up the overlapping roofline numeric values by moving them into the side legend.
  * Added AI points chart with respective values, cache level, and compute/memory bound status.
  * Added full kernel names to the symbol chart.

#### Resolved issues

* Resolved existing issues to improve stability.

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (1.2.1)

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed an issue of OpenMP Tools (OMPT) events, GPU performance counters, VA-API, MPI, and host events failing to be collected in the `rocpd` output.

### **ROCm Validation Suite** (1.3.0)

#### Added

* Support for different test levels with `-r` option for AMD Instinct MI3XXx GPUs.
* Set compute type for DGEMM operations on AMD Instinct MI350X and MI355X GPUs.

### **rocSHMEM** (3.1.0)

#### Added

* Allowed IPC, RO, and GDA backends to be selected at runtime.
* GDA conduit for different NIC vendors:
   * Broadcom BNXT\_RE (Thor 2)
   * Mellanox MLX5 (IB and RoCE ConnectX-7)
* New APIs:
   * `rocshmem_get_device_ctx`

#### Changed

* The following APIs have been deprecated:
  * `rocshmem_wg_init`
  * `rocshmem_wg_finalize`
  * `rocshmem_wg_init_thread`

* `rocshmem_ptr`  can now return non-null pointer to a shared memory region when the IPC transport is available to reach that region. Previously, it would return a null pointer.
* `ROCSHMEM_RO_DISABLE_IPC` is renamed to `ROCSHMEM_DISABLE_MIXED_IPC`. 
    - This environment variable wasn't documented in earlier releases. It's now documented.

#### Removed

* rocSHMEM no longer requires rocPRIM and rocThrust as dependencies.
* Removed MPI compile-time dependency.

#### Known issues

* Only a subset of rocSHMEM APIs are implemented for the GDA conduit.

### **rocWMMA** (2.1.0)

#### Added

* More unit tests to increase the code coverage.

#### Changed

* Increased compile timeout and improved visualization in `math-ci`.

#### Removed

* Absolute paths from the `RPATH` of sample and test binary files.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed issues caused by HIP changes:
    * Removed the `.data` member from `HIP_vector_type`.
    * Broadcast constructor now only writes to the first vector element.
* Fixed a bug related to `int32_t` usage in `hipRTC_gemm` for gfx942, caused by breaking changes in HIP.
* Replaced `#pragma unroll` with `static for` to fix a bug caused by the upgraded compiler which no longer supports using `#pragma unroll` with template parameter indices.
* Corrected test predicates for `BLK` and `VW` cooperative kernels.
* Modified `compute_utils.sh` in `build-infra` to ensure rocWMMA is built with gfx1151 target for ROCm 7.0 and beyond.

## ROCm 7.1.0

See the [ROCm 7.1.0 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-7.1.0/about/release-notes.html#rocm-7-1-0-release-notes)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (26.1.0)

#### Added

* `GPU LINK PORT STATUS` table to `amd-smi xgmi` command. The `amd-smi xgmi -s` or `amd-smi xgmi --source-status` will now show the `GPU LINK PORT STATUS` table.  

* `amdsmi_get_gpu_revision()` to Python API. This function retrieves the GPU revision ID. Available in `amdsmi_interface.py` as `amdsmi_get_gpu_revision()`.

* Gpuboard and baseboard temperatures to `amd-smi metric` command.

#### Changed

* Struct `amdsmi_topology_nearest_t` member `processor_list`. Member size changed, processor_list[AMDSMI_MAX_DEVICES * AMDSMI_MAX_NUM_XCP].

* `amd-smi reset --profile` behavior so that it won't also reset the performance level.  
  * The performance level can still be reset using `amd-smi reset --perf-determinism`.  

* Setting power cap is now available in Linux Guest. You can now use `amd-smi set --power-cap` as usual in Linux Guest systems too.

* Changed `amd-smi static --vbios` to `amd-smi static --ifwi`.  
  * VBIOS naming is replaced with IFWI (Integrated Firmware Image) for improved clarity and consistency.
  * AMD Instinct MI300 Series GPUs (and later) now use a new version format with enhanced build information.
  * Legacy command `amd-smi static --vbios` remains functional for backward compatibility, but displays updated IFWI heading.
  * The Python, C, and Rust API for `amdsmi_get_gpu_vbios_version()` will now have a new field called `boot_firmware`, which will return the legacy vbios version number that is also known as the Unified BootLoader (UBL) version.

#### Optimized

* Optimized the way `amd-smi process` validates, which processes are running on a GPU. 

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed a CPER record count mismatch issue when using the `amd-smi ras --cper --file-limit`. Updated the deletion calculation to use `files_to_delete = len(folder_files) - file_limit` for exact file count management.

* Fixed the event monitoring segfaults causing RDC to crash. Added the mutex locking around access to device event notification file pointer.

* Fixed an issue where using `amd-smi ras --folder <folder_name>` was forcing the created folder's name to be lowercase. This fix also makes all string input options case-insensitive.

* Fixed certain output in `amd-smi monitor` when GPUs are partitioned. It fixes the issue with amd-smi monitor such as: `amd-smi monitor -Vqt`, `amd-smi monitor -g 0 -Vqt -w 1`, and `amd-smi monitor -Vqt --file /tmp/test1`. These commands will now be able to display as normal in partitioned GPU scenarios.

```

### **Composable Kernel** (1.1.0)

#### Added
 
* Support for hdim as a multiple of 32 for FMHA (fwd/fwd_splitkv/bwd).
* Support for elementwise kernel.
 
#### Upcoming changes
 
* Non-grouped convolutions are deprecated. Their functionality is supported by grouped convolution.

### **HIP** (7.1.0)

#### Added

* New HIP APIs
    - `hipModuleGetFunctionCount` returns the number of functions within a module
    - `hipMemsetD2D8` sets 2D memory range with specified 8-bit values
    - `hipMemsetD2D8Async` asynchronously sets 2D memory range with specified 8-bit values
    - `hipMemsetD2D16` sets 2D memory range with specified 16-bit values
    - `hipMemsetD2D16Async` asynchronously sets 2D memory range with specified 16-bit values
    - `hipMemsetD2D32` sets 2D memory range with specified 32-bit values
    - `hipMemsetD2D32Async` asynchronously sets 2D memory range with specified 32-bit values
    - `hipStreamSetAttribute` sets attributes such as synchronization policy for a given stream
    - `hipStreamGetAttribute` returns attributes such as priority for a given stream
    - `hipModuleLoadFatBinary`  loads fatbin binary to a module
    - `hipMemcpyBatchAsync` asynchronously performs a batch copy of 1D or 2D memory
    - `hipMemcpy3DBatchAsync` asynchronously performs a batch copy of 3D memory
    - `hipMemcpy3DPeer` copies memory between devices
    - `hipMemcpy3DPeerAsync` asynchronously copies memory between devices
    - `hipMemsetD2D32Async` asynchronously sets 2D memory range with specified 32-bit values
    - `hipMemPrefetchAsync_v2`  prefetches memory to the specified location
    - `hipMemAdvise_v2`         advises about the usage of a given memory range
    - `hipGetDriverEntryPoint ` gets function pointer of a HIP API.
    - `hipSetValidDevices`      sets a default list of devices that can be used by HIP
    - `hipStreamGetId`          queries the id of a stream
* Support for nested tile partitioning within cooperative groups, matching CUDA functionality.

#### Optimized

* Improved HIP module loading latency.
* Optimized kernel metadata retrieval during module post-load.
* Optimized doorbell ring in HIP runtime for the following performance improvements:
    - Makes efficient packet batching for HIP graph launch
    - Dynamic packet copying based on a defined maximum threshold or power-of-2 staggered copy pattern
    - If timestamps are not collected for a signal for reuse, it creates a new signal. This can potentially increase the signal footprint if the handler doesn't run fast enough

#### Resolved issues

* A segmentation fault occurred in the application when capturing the same HIP graph from multiple streams with cross-stream dependencies.  The HIP runtime has fixed an issue where a forked stream joined to a parent stream that was not originally created with the API `hipStreamBeginCapture`.
* Different behavior of en-queuing command on a legacy stream during stream capture on AMD ROCM platform, compared with CUDA. HIP runtime now returns an error in this specific situation to match CUDA behavior.
* Failure of memory access fault occurred in rocm-examples test suite. When Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM) is not supported in the driver, `hipMallocManaged` will only allocate system memory in HIP runtime.

#### Known issues

* SPIR-V-enabled applications might encounter a segmentation fault. The problem doesn't exist when SPIR-V is disabled. The issue will be fixed in the next ROCm release. 

### **hipBLAS** (3.1.0)

#### Added

* `--clients-only` build option to only build clients against a prebuilt library.
* gfx1150, gfx1151, gfx1200, and gfx1201 support enabled.
* FORTRAN enabled for the Microsoft Windows build and tests.
* Additional reference library fallback options added.

#### Changed

* Improved the build time for clients by removing `clients_common.cpp` from the hipblas-test build.

### **hipBLASLt** (1.1.0)

#### Added

* Fused Clamp GEMM for ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_EXT`` and ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_BIAS_EXT``. This feature requires the minimum (``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_EPILOGUE_ACT_ARG0_EXT``) and maximum (``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_EPILOGUE_ACT_ARG1_EXT``) to be set.
* Support for ReLU/Clamp activation functions with auxiliary output for the `FP16` and `BF16` data types for gfx942 to capture intermediate results. This feature is enabled for ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_RELU_AUX``, ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_RELU_AUX_BIAS``, ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_AUX_EXT``, and ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_AUX_BIAS_EXT``.
* Support for `HIPBLAS_COMPUTE_32F_FAST_16BF` for FP32 data type for gfx950 only.
* CPP extension APIs ``setMaxWorkspaceBytes`` and ``getMaxWorkspaceBytes``.
* Feature to print logs (using ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK=32``) for Grouped GEMM.
* Support for swizzleA by using the hipblaslt-ext cpp API.
* Support for hipBLASLt extop for gfx11XX and gfx12XX.

#### Changed

* ``hipblasLtMatmul()`` now returns an error when the workspace size is insufficient, rather than causing a segmentation fault.

#### Optimized

* `TF32` kernel optimization for the AMD Instinct MI355X GPU to enhance training and inference efficiency.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed incorrect results when using ldd and ldc dimension parameters with some solutions.

### **hipCUB** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* Exposed Thread-level reduction API `hipcub::ThreadReduce`.
* `::hipcub::extents`, with limited parity to C++23's `std::extents`. Only `static extents` is supported; `dynamic extents` is not. Helper structs have been created to perform computations on `::hipcub::extents` only when the backend is rocPRIM. For the CUDA backend, similar functionality exists.
* `projects/hipcub/hipcub/include/hipcub/backend/rocprim/util_mdspan.hpp` to support `::hipcub::extents`.
* `::hipcub::ForEachInExtents` API.
* `hipcub::DeviceTransform::Transform` and `hipcub::DeviceTransform::TransformStableArgumentAddresses`.
* hipCUB and its dependency rocPRIM have been moved into the new `rocm-libraries` [monorepo repository](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries). This repository contains a number of ROCm libraries that are frequently used together.
  * The repository migration requires a few changes to the way that hipCUB fetches library dependencies.
  * CMake build option `ROCPRIM_FETCH_METHOD` may be set to one of the following:
    * `PACKAGE` - (default) searches for a preinstalled packaged version of the dependency. If it is not found, the build will fall back using option `DOWNLOAD`, below.
    * `DOWNLOAD` - downloads the dependency from the rocm-libraries repository. If git >= 2.25 is present, this option uses a sparse checkout that avoids downloading more than it needs to. If not, the whole monorepo is downloaded (this may take some time).
    * `MONOREPO` - this option is intended to be used if you are building hipCUB from within a copy of the rocm-libraries repository that you have cloned (and therefore already contains rocPRIM). When selected, the build will try find the dependency in the local repository tree. If it cannot be found, the build will attempt to use git to perform a sparse-checkout of rocPRIM. If that also fails, it will fall back to using the `DOWNLOAD` option described above.

* A new CMake option `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIB` to allow tests to be built from installed `hipCUB` provided by the system.

#### Changed

* Changed include headers to avoid relative includes that have slipped in.
* Changed `CUDA_STANDARD` for tests in `test/hipcub`, due to C++17 APIs such as `std::exclusive_scan` is used in some tests. Still use `CUDA_STANDARD 14` for `test/extra`.
* Changed `CCCL_MINIMUM_VERSION` to `2.8.2` to align with CUB.
* Changed `cmake_minimum_required` from `3.16` to `3.18`, in order to support `CUDA_STANDARD 17` as a valid value.
* Add support for large num_items `DeviceScan`, `DevicePartition` and `Reduce::{ArgMin, ArgMax}`.
* Added tests for large num_items.
* The previous dependency-related build option `DEPENDENCIES_FORCE_DOWNLOAD` has been renamed `EXTERNAL_DEPS_FORCE_DOWNLOAD` to differentiate it from the new rocPRIM dependency option described above. Its behavior remains the same - it forces non-ROCm dependencies (Google Benchmark and Google Test) to be downloaded rather than searching for installed packages. This option defaults to `OFF`.

#### Removed

* Removed `TexRefInputIterator`, which was removed from CUB after CCCL's 2.6.0 release. This API should have already been removed, but somehow it remained and was not tested.
* Deprecated `hipcub::ConstantInputIterator`, use `rocprim::constant_iterator` or `rocthrust::constant_iterator` instead.
* Deprecated `hipcub::CountingInputIterator`, use `rocprim::counting_iterator` or `rocthrust::counting_iterator` instead.
* Deprecated `hipcub::DiscardOutputIterator`, use `rocprim::discard_iterator` or `rocthrust::discard_iterator` instead.
* Deprecated `hipcub::TransformInputIterator`, use `rocprim::transform_iterator` or `rocthrust::transform_iterator` instead.
* Deprecated `hipcub::AliasTemporaries`, which is considered to be an internal API. Moved to the detail namespace.
* Deprecated almost all functions in `projects/hipcub/hipcub/include/hipcub/backend/rocprim/util_ptx.hpp`.
* Deprecated hipCUB macros: `HIPCUB_MAX`, `HIPCUB_MIN`, `HIPCUB_QUOTIENT_FLOOR`, `HIPCUB_QUOTIENT_CEILING`, `HIPCUB_ROUND_UP_NEAREST` and `HIPCUB_ROUND_DOWN_NEAREST`.

#### Known issues

* The `__half` template specializations of Simd operators are currently disabled due to possible build issues with PyTorch.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.21)

### **hipRAND** (3.1.0)

#### Resolved issues

* Updated error handling for several hipRAND unit tests to accommodate the new `hipGetLastError` behavior that was introduced in ROCm 7.0.0. As of ROCm 7.0.0, the internal error state is cleared on each call to `hipGetLastError` rather than on every HIP API call.

### **hipSOLVER** (3.1.0)

#### Added

* Extended test suites for `hipsolverDn` compatibility functions.

#### Changed

* Changed code coverage to use `llvm-cov` instead of `gcov`.

* `RCCL_P2P_BATCH_ENABLE` to enable batching P2P operations to receive performance gains for smaller messages up to 4MB for alltoall when the workload requires it. This is to avoid performance dips for larger messages.

#### Changed

* The MSCCL++ feature is now disabled by default. The `--disable-mscclpp` build flag is replaced with `--enable-mscclpp` in the `rccl/install.sh` script.
* Compatibility with NCCL 2.27.7.

#### Optimized
* Enabled and optimized batched P2P operations to improve small message performance for `AllToAll` and `AllGather`.
* Optimized channel count selection to improve efficiency for small-to-medium message sizes in `ReduceScatter`.
* Changed code inlining to improve latency for small message sizes for `AllReduce`, `AllGather`, and `ReduceScatter`.

#### Known issues

* Symmetric memory kernels are currently disabled due to ongoing CUMEM enablement work.
* When running this version of RCCL using ROCm versions earlier than 6.4.0, the user must set the environment flag `HSA_NO_SCRATCH_RECLAIM=1`.

  * Write and Atomic BW (section 1702)
  * Bandwidth (section 1703)
  * Atomic/Read/Write Bandwidth (section 1703)
  * Atomic/Read/Write Bandwidth - (HBM/PCIe/Infinity Fabric) (section 1706)
* Updated the metric name for the following `Bandwidth` related metrics whose `Unit` is `Percent` by adding `Utilization`:
  * Theoretical Bandwidth Utilization (section 1201)

  * L2-Fabric Write BW
  * Kernel Time
  * Kernel Time (Cycles)
  * SIMD Utilization

    * Use ``--output-name`` analysis mode option to override the default file/folder name.
  * Replaced `--save-dfs` analyze mode option with `--output-format csv`.
* Command-line options:
  * `--list-metrics` and `--config-dir` options moved to general command-line options.
  * `--list-metrics` option cannot be used without GPU architecture argument.
  * `--list-metrics` option do not show number of L2 channels.
  * `--list-available-metrics` profile mode option to display the metrics available for profiling in current GPU.
  * `--list-available-metrics` analyze mode option to display the metrics available for analysis.
  * `--block` option cannot be used with `--list-metrics` and `--list-available-metrics`options.
* Default `rocprof` interface changed from `rocprofv3` to `rocprofiler-sdk`
  * Use ROCPROF=rocprofv3 to use rocprofv3 interface
* Updated metric names for better alignment between analysis configuration and documentation.

#### Removed

* Usage of `rocm-smi` in favor of `amd-smi`.
* Hardware IP block-based filtering has been removed in favor of analysis report block-based filtering.
* Aggregated analysis view from TUI analyze mode.

#### Optimized

* Improved `--time-unit` option in analyze mode to apply time unit conversion across all analysis sections, not just kernel top stats.
* Improved logic to obtain rocprof-supported counters, which prevents unnecessary warnings.
* Improved post-analysis runtime performance by caching and multi-processing.

* Fixed L2 read/write/atomic bandwidths on AMD Instinct MI350 Series GPUs.
* Fixed an issue where accumulation counters could not be collected on AMD Instinct MI100.
* Fixed an issue of kernel filtering not working in the roofline chart.

#### Known issues

* MI300A/X L2-Fabric 64B read counter may display negative values - The rocprof-compute metric 17.6.1 (Read 64B) can report negative values due to incorrect calculation when TCC_BUBBLE_sum + TCC_EA0_RDREQ_32B_sum exceeds TCC_EA0_RDREQ_sum.
  * A workaround has been implemented using max(0, calculated_value) to prevent negative display values while the root cause is under investigation.
* The profile mode crashes when `--format-rocprof-output json` is selected.
    * As a workaround, this option should either not be provided or should be set to `csv` instead of `json`. This issue does not affect the profiling results since both `csv` and `json` output formats lead to the same profiling data.  

### **ROCm Data Center Tool** (1.2.0)

#### Added

- CPU monitoring support with 30+ CPU field definitions through AMD SMI integration.
- CPU partition format support (c0.0, c1.0) for monitoring AMD EPYC processors.
- Mixed GPU/CPU monitoring in single `rdci dmon` command.

#### Optimized

- Improved profiler metrics path detection for counter definitions.

#### Resolved issues

- Group management issues with listing created/non-created groups.
- ECC_UNCORRECT field behavior.

### **ROCm Debugger (ROCgdb)** (16.3)

#### Added

* gfx1150 and gfx1151 support enabled.

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (1.2.0)

#### Added

- ``ROCPROFSYS_ROCM_GROUP_BY_QUEUE`` configuration setting to allow grouping of events by hardware queue, instead of the default grouping.
- Support for `rocpd` database output with the `ROCPROFSYS_USE_ROCPD` configuration setting.
- Support for profiling PyTorch workloads using the `rocpd` output database.
- Support for tracing OpenMP API in Fortran applications.
- An error warning is triggered if the profiler application fails because SELinux enforcement is enabled. The warning includes steps to disable SELinux enforcement.

#### Changed

- Updated the grouping of "kernel dispatch" and "memory copy" events in Perfetto traces. They are now grouped together by HIP Stream rather than separately and by hardware queue.
- Updated PAPI module to v7.2.0b2.
- ROCprofiler-SDK is now used for tracing OMPT API calls.

#### Known issues

* Profiling PyTorch and other AI workloads might fail because it is unable to find the libraries in the default linker path. As a workaround, you need to explicitly add the library path to ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``. For example, when using PyTorch with Python 3.10, add the following to the environment:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/opt/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### **rocPRIM** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* `get_sreg_lanemask_lt`, `get_sreg_lanemask_le`, `get_sreg_lanemask_gt` and `get_sreg_lanemask_ge`.
* `rocprim::transform_output_iterator` and `rocprim::make_transform_output_iterator`.
* Experimental support for SPIR-V, to use the correct tuned config for part of the appliable algorithms.
* A new cmake option, `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS`. When rocPRIM is build with this option enabled, the `--offload-compress` switch is passed to the compiler. This causes the compiler to compress the binary that it generates. Compression can be useful in cases where you are compiling for a large number of targets, since this often results in a large binary. Without compression, in some cases, the generated binary may become so large symbols are placed out of range, resulting in linking errors. The new `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` option is set to `ON` by default.
* A new CMake option `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIB` to allow tests to be built from `ROCm` libraries provided by the system.
* `rocprim::apply` which applies a function to a `rocprim::tuple`.

#### Changed

* Changed tests to support `ptr-to-const` output in `/test/rocprim/test_device_batch_memcpy.cpp`.

#### Optimized

* Improved performance of many algorithms by updating their tuned configs.
  * 891 specializations have been improved.
  * 399 specializations have been added.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed `device_select`, `device_merge`, and `device_merge_sort` not allocating the correct amount of virtual shared memory on the host.
* Fixed the `-&gt;` operator for the `transform_iterator`, the `texture_cache_iterator`, and the `arg_index_iterator`, by now returning a proxy pointer.
  * The `arg_index_iterator` also now only returns the internal iterator for the `-&gt;`.

#### Upcoming changes

* Deprecated the `-&gt;` operator for the `zip_iterator`.

### **ROCProfiler** (2.0.0)

#### Removed

* `rocprofv2` doesn't support gfx12XX Series GPUs. For gfx12XX Series GPUs, use `rocprofv3` tool.

### **ROCprofiler-SDK** (1.0.0)

#### Added
* Dynamic process attachment- ROCprofiler-SDK and `rocprofv3` now facilitate dynamic profiling of a running GPU application by attaching to its process ID (PID), rather than launching the application through the profiler itself.
* Scratch-memory trace information to the Perfetto output in `rocprofv3`.
* New capabilities to the thread trace support in `rocprofv3`:
    * Real-time clock support for thread trace alignment on gfx9XX architecture. This enables high-resolution clock computation and better synchronization across shader engines. 
    * `MultiKernelDispatch` thread trace support is now available across all ASICs.
* Documentation for dynamic process attachment.
* Documentation for `rocpd` summaries.

#### Optimized
* Improved the stability and robustness of the `rocpd` output.

### **rocPyDecode** (0.7.0)

#### Added
* rocPyJpegPerfSample - samples for JPEG decode

#### Changed
* Package - rocjpeg set as required dependency.
* rocDecode host - rocdecode host linking updates

#### Resolved issues
* rocJPEG Bindings - bug fixes
* Test package - find dependencies updated

### **rocRAND** (4.1.0)

#### Changed

* Changed the `USE_DEVICE_DISPATCH` flag so it can turn device dispatch off by setting it to zero. Device dispatch should be turned off when building for SPIRV.

#### Resolved issues

* Updated error handling for several rocRAND unit tests to accommodate the new `hipGetLastError` behavior that was introduced in ROCm 7.0.
As of ROCm 7.0, the internal error state is cleared on each call to `hipGetLastError` rather than on every HIP API call.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.31.0)

#### Optimized

Improved the performance of:

* LARF, LARFT, GEQR2, and downstream functions such as GEQRF.
* STEDC and divide and conquer Eigensolvers.

### **rocSPARSE** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* Brain half float mixed precision for the following routines:
   * `rocsparse_axpby` where X and Y use bfloat16 and result and the compute type use float.
   * `rocsparse_spvv` where X and Y use bfloat16 and result and the compute type use float.
   * `rocsparse_spmv` where A and X use bfloat16 and Y and the compute type use float.
   * `rocsparse_spmm` where A and B use bfloat16 and C and the compute type use float.
   * `rocsparse_sddmm` where A and B use bfloat16 and C and the compute type use float.
   * `rocsparse_sddmm` where A and B and C use bfloat16 and the compute type use float.
* Half float mixed precision to `rocsparse_sddmm` where A and B and C use float16 and the compute type use float.
* Brain half float uniform precision to `rocsparse_scatter` and `rocsparse_gather` routines.

#### Optimized

* Improved the user documentation.

#### Upcoming changes

* Deprecate trace, debug, and bench logging using the environment variable `ROCSPARSE_LAYER`.

### **rocThrust** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* A new CMake option `-DSQLITE_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE` to allow SQLite to be provided by the system.
* Introduced `libhipcxx` as a soft dependency. When `libhipcxx` can be included, rocThrust can use structs and methods defined in `libhipcxx`. This allows for a more complete behavior parity with CCCL and mirrors CCCL's thrust own dependency on `libcudacxx`.
* Added a new CMake option `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIB` to allow tests to be built from `ROCm` libraries provided by the system.

#### Changed

* The previously hidden cmake build option `FORCE_DEPENDENCIES_DOWNLOAD` has been unhidden and renamed `EXTERNAL_DEPS_FORCE_DOWNLOAD` to differentiate it from the new rocPRIM and rocRAND dependency options described above. Its behavior remains the same - it forces non-ROCm dependencies (Google Benchmark, Google Test, and SQLite) to be downloaded instead of searching for existing installed packages. This option defaults to `OFF`.

#### Removed

* The previous dependency-related build options `DOWNLOAD_ROCPRIM` and `DOWNLOAD_ROCRAND` have been removed. Use `ROCPRIM_FETCH_METHOD=DOWNLOAD` and `ROCRAND_FETCH_METHOD=DOWNLOAD` instead.

#### Known issues

* `event` test is failing on CI and local runs on MI300, MI250 and MI210.

* rocThrust, as well as its dependencies rocPRIM and rocRAND have been moved into the new `rocm-libraries` monorepo repository (https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries). This repository contains several ROCm libraries that are frequently used together.
  * The repository migration requires a few changes to the way that rocThrust's ROCm library dependencies are fetched.
  * There are new cmake options for obtaining rocPRIM and (optionally, if BUILD_BENCHMARKS is enabled) rocRAND.
  * cmake build options `ROCPRIM_FETCH_METHOD` and `ROCRAND_FETCH_METHOD` may be set to one of the following:
    * `PACKAGE` - (default) searches for a preinstalled packaged version of the dependency. If it's not found, the build will fall back using option `DOWNLOAD`, described below.
    * `DOWNLOAD` - downloads the dependency from the rocm-libraries repository. If git >= 2.25 is present, this option uses a sparse checkout that avoids downloading more than it needs to. If not, the whole monorepo is downloaded (this may take some time).
    * `MONOREPO` - this option is intended to be used if you are building rocThrust from within a copy of the rocm-libraries repository that you have cloned (and therefore already contains the dependencies rocPRIM and rocRAND). When selected, the build will try to find the dependency in the local repository tree. If it can't be found, the build will attempt to add it to the local tree using a sparse-checkout. If that also fails, it will fall back to using the `DOWNLOAD` option.

### **RPP** (2.1.0)

#### Added

* Solarize augmentation for HOST and HIP.
* Hue and Saturation adjustment augmentations for HOST and HIP.
* Find RPP - cmake module.
* Posterize augmentation for HOST and HIP.

#### Changed

* HALF - Fix `half.hpp` path updates.
* Box filter - padding updates.

#### Removed

* Packaging - Removed Meta Package dependency for HIP.
* SLES 15 SP6 support.

#### Resolved issues

* Test Suite - Fixes for accuracy.
* HIP Backend - Check return status warning fixes.
* Bug fix - HIP vector types init.

## ROCm 7.0.2

See the [ROCm 7.0.2 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-7.0.2/about/release-notes.html#rocm-7-0-2-release-notes)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (26.0.2)

#### Added

* Added `bad_page_threshold_exceeded` field to `amd-smi static --ras`, which compares retired pages count against bad page threshold. This field displays `True` if retired pages exceed the threshold, `False` if within threshold, or `N/A` if threshold data is unavailable. Note that `sudo` is required to have the `bad_page_threshold_exceeded` field populated.

#### Removed

* Removed gpuboard and baseboard temperatures enums in amdsmi Python Library.
    * `AmdSmiTemperatureType` had issues with referencing the correct attribute. As such, the following duplicate enums have been removed:
        - `AmdSmiTemperatureType.GPUBOARD_NODE_FIRST`
        - `AmdSmiTemperatureType.GPUBOARD_VR_FIRST`
        - `AmdSmiTemperatureType.BASEBOARD_FIRST`

#### Resolved Issues

* Fixed `attribute error` in `amd-smi monitor` on Linux Guest systems, where the violations argument caused CLI to break.
* Fixed certain output in `amd-smi monitor` when GPUs are partitioned.  
  * It fixes the amd-smi monitor such as: `amd-smi monitor -Vqt`, `amd-smi monitor -g 0 -Vqt -w 1`, `amd-smi monitor -Vqt --file /tmp/test1`, etc. These commands will now be able to display as normal in partitioned GPU scenarios.

* Fixed an issue where using `amd-smi ras --folder <folder_name>` was forcing the created folder's name to be lowercase. This fix also allows all string input options to be case insensitive.

* Fixed an issue of some processes not being detected by AMD SMI despite making use of KFD resources. This fix, with the addition of KFD Fallback for process detection, ensures that all KFD processes will be detected.

* Multiple CPER issues were fixed.  
  - Issue of being unable to query for additional CPERs after 20 were generated on a single device.
  - Issue where the RAS HBM CRC read was failing due to an incorrect AFID value.
  - Issue where RAS injections were not consistently producing related CPERs.

### **HIP** (7.0.2)

#### Added

* Support for the `hipMemAllocationTypeUncached` flag, enabling developers to allocate uncached memory. This flag is now supported in the following APIs:
    - `hipMemGetAllocationGranularity` determines the recommended allocation granularity for uncached memory.
    - `hipMemCreate` allocates memory with uncached properties.

#### Resolved issues

* A compilation failure affecting applications that compile kernels using `hiprtc` with the compiler option `std=c++11`.
* A permission-related error occurred during the execution of `hipLaunchHostFunc`. This API is now supported and permitted to run during stream capture, aligning its behavior with CUDA.
* A numerical error during graph capture of kernels that rely on a remainder in `globalWorkSize`, in frameworks like MIOpen and PyTorch, where the grid size is not a multiple of the block size. To ensure correct replay behavior, HIP runtime now stores this remainder in `hip::GraphKernelNode` during `hipExtModuleLaunchKernel` capture, enabling accurate execution and preventing corruption.
* A page fault occurred during viewport rendering while running the file undo.blend in Blender. The issue was resolved by the HIP runtime, which reused the same context during image creation.
* Resolved a segmentation fault in `gpu_metrics`, which is used in threshold logic for command submission patches to GPU device(s) during CPU synchronization.

### **hipBLAS** (3.0.2)
 
#### Added
 
* Enabled support for gfx1150, gfx1151, gfx1200, and gfx1201 AMD hardware.

### **RCCL** (2.26.6)

#### Added

* Enabled double-buffering in `reduceCopyPacks` to trigger pipelining, especially to overlap bf16 arithmetic.
* Added `--force-reduce-pipeline` as an option that can be passed to the `install.sh` script. Passing this option will enable software-triggered pipelining `bfloat16` reductions (that is, `all_reduce`, `reduce_scatter`, and `reduce`).

### **rocBLAS** (5.0.2)
 
#### Added
 
* Enabled gfx1150 and gfx1151.
* The `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT_BATCHED` variable to independently control the batched hipblaslt backend. Set `ROCBLAS_USE_HIPBLASLT_BATCHED=0` to disable batched GEMM use of the hipblaslt backend.

#### Resolved issues
 
* Set the imaginary portion of the main diagonal of the output matrix to zero in syrk and herk.

### **ROCdbgapi** (0.77.4)

#### Added

* ROCdbgapi documentation link in the README.md file.

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (1.1.1)

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where ROC-TX ranges were displayed as two separate events instead of a single spanning event.

### **rocPRIM** (4.0.1)

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed compilation issue when using `rocprim::texture_cache_iterator`.
* Fixed a HIP version check used to determine whether `hipStreamLegacy` is supported. This resolves runtime errors that occur when `hipStreamLegacy` is used in ROCm 7.0.0 and later.

### **rocSPARSE** (4.0.3)

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue causing premature deallocation of internal buffers while still in use.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.30.1)

#### Optimized

Improved the performance of:

* LARFT and downstream functions such as GEQRF and ORMTR.
* LARF and downstream functions such as GEQR2.
* ORMTR and downstream functions such as SYEVD.
* GEQR2 and downstream functions such as GEQRF.

## ROCm 7.0.1

ROCm 7.0.1 is a quality release that resolves the existing issue. There is no change in component from the previous ROCm 7.0.0 release. See the [ROCm 7.0.1 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-7.0.1/about/release-notes.html#rocm-7-0-1-release-notes) for a complete overview of this release.

## ROCm 7.0.0

See the [ROCm 7.0.0 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-7.0.0/about/release-notes.html#rocm-7-0-0-release-notes)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (26.0.0)

#### Added

* Ability to restart the AMD GPU driver from the CLI and API.
  - `amdsmi_gpu_driver_reload()` API and `amd-smi reset --reload-driver` or `amd-smi reset -r` CLI options.
  - Driver reload functionality is now separated from memory partition
    functions; memory partition change requests should now be followed by a driver reload.
  - Driver reload requires all GPU activity on all devices to be stopped.

* Default command:

  A default view has been added. The default view provides a snapshot of commonly requested information such as bdf, current partition mode, version information, and more. Users can access that information by simply typing `amd-smi` with no additional commands or arguments. Users may also obtain this information through alternate output formats such as json or csv by using the default command with the respective output format: `amd-smi default --json` or `amd-smi default --csv`.

* Support for GPU metrics 1.8:
  - Added new fields for `amdsmi_gpu_xcp_metrics_t` including:
    - Metrics to allow new calculations for violation status:
      - Per XCP metrics `gfx_below_host_limit_ppt_acc[XCP][MAX_XCC]` - GFX Clock Host limit Package Power Tracking violation counts
      - Per XCP metrics `gfx_below_host_limit_thm_acc[XCP][MAX_XCC]` - GFX Clock Host limit Thermal (TVIOL) violation counts
      - Per XCP metrics `gfx_low_utilization_acc[XCP][MAX_XCC]` - violation counts for how did low utilization caused the GPU to be below application clocks.
      - Per XCP metrics `gfx_below_host_limit_total_acc[XCP][MAX_XCC]`- violation counts for how long GPU was held below application clocks any limiter (see above new violation metrics).
  - Increased available JPEG engines to 40. Current ASICs might not support all 40. These are indicated as `UINT16_MAX` or `N/A` in CLI.

* Bad page threshold count.
  - Added `amdsmi_get_gpu_bad_page_threshold` to Python API and CLI; root/sudo permissions are required to display the count.

* CPU model name for RDC.
  - Added new C and Python API `amdsmi_get_cpu_model_name`.
  - Not sourced from esmi library.

* New API `amdsmi_get_cpu_affinity_with_scope()`.

* `socket power` to `amdsmi_get_power_info`
  - Previously, the C API had the value in the `amdsmi_power_info` structure, but was unused.
  - The value is representative of the socket's power agnostic of the the GPU version.

* New event notification types to `amdsmi_evt_notification_type_t`.
  The following values were added to the `amdsmi_evt_notification_type_t` enum:
  - `AMDSMI_EVT_NOTIF_EVENT_MIGRATE_START`
  - `AMDSMI_EVT_NOTIF_EVENT_MIGRATE_END`
  - `AMDSMI_EVT_NOTIF_EVENT_PAGE_FAULT_START`
  - `AMDSMI_EVT_NOTIF_EVENT_PAGE_FAULT_END`
  - `AMDSMI_EVT_NOTIF_EVENT_QUEUE_EVICTION`
  - `AMDSMI_EVT_NOTIF_EVENT_QUEUE_RESTORE`
  - `AMDSMI_EVT_NOTIF_EVENT_UNMAP_FROM_GPU`
  - `AMDSMI_EVT_NOTIF_PROCESS_START`
  - `AMDSMI_EVT_NOTIF_PROCESS_END`

- Power cap to `amd-smi monitor`.
  - `amd-smi monitor -p` will display the power cap along with power.

#### Changed

* Separated driver reload functionality from `amdsmi_set_gpu_memory_partition()` and
  `amdsmi_set_gpu_memory_partition_mode()` APIs -- and from the CLI `amd-smi set -M <NPS mode>`.

* Disabled `amd-smi monitor --violation` on guests. Modified `amd-smi metric -T/--throttle` to alias to `amd-smi metric -v/--violation`.

* Updated `amdsmi_get_clock_info` in `amdsmi_interface.py`.
  - The `clk_deep_sleep` field now returns the sleep integer value.

* The `amd-smi topology` command has been enabled for guest environments.
  - This includes full functionality so users can use the command just as they would in bare metal environments.

* Expanded violation status tracking for GPU metrics 1.8.
  - The driver will no longer be supporting existing single-value GFX clock below host limit fields (`acc_gfx_clk_below_host_limit`, `per_gfx_clk_below_host_limit`, `active_gfx_clk_below_host_limit`), they are now changed in favor of new per-XCP/XCC arrays.
  - Added new fields to `amdsmi_violation_status_t` and related interfaces for enhanced violation breakdown:
    - Per-XCP/XCC accumulators and status for:
      - GFX clock below host limit (power, thermal, and total)
      - Low utilization
    - Added 2D arrays to track per-XCP/XCC accumulators, percentage, and active status:
      - `acc_gfx_clk_below_host_limit_pwr`, `acc_gfx_clk_below_host_limit_thm`, `acc_gfx_clk_below_host_limit_total`
      - `per_gfx_clk_below_host_limit_pwr`, `per_gfx_clk_below_host_limit_thm`, `per_gfx_clk_below_host_limit_total`
      - `active_gfx_clk_below_host_limit_pwr`, `active_gfx_clk_below_host_limit_thm`, `active_gfx_clk_below_host_limit_total`
      - `acc_low_utilization`, `per_low_utilization`, `active_low_utilization`
  - Python API and CLI now report these expanded fields.

* The char arrays in the following structures have been changed.
  - `amdsmi_vbios_info_t` member `build_date` changed from `AMDSMI_MAX_DATE_LENGTH` to `AMDSMI_MAX_STRING_LENGTH`.
  - `amdsmi_dpm_policy_entry_t` member `policy_description` changed from `AMDSMI_MAX_NAME` to `AMDSMI_MAX_STRING_LENGTH`.
  - `amdsmi_name_value_t` member `name` changed from `AMDSMI_MAX_NAME` to `AMDSMI_MAX_STRING_LENGTH`.

* For backwards compatibility, updated `amdsmi_bdf_t` union to have an identical unnamed struct.

* Updated `amdsmi_get_temp_metric` and `amdsmi_temperature_type_t` with new values.
  - Added new values to `amdsmi_temperature_type_t` representing various baseboard and GPU board temperature measures.
  - Updated `amdsmi_get_temp_metric` API to be able to take in and return the respective values for the new temperature types.

#### Removed

- Unnecessary API, `amdsmi_free_name_value_pairs()`
  - This API is only used internally to free up memory from the Python interface and does not need to be
    exposed to the user.

- Unused definitions:
  - `AMDSMI_MAX_NAME`, `AMDSMI_256_LENGTH`, `AMDSMI_MAX_DATE_LENGTH`, `MAX_AMDSMI_NAME_LENGTH`, `AMDSMI_LIB_VERSION_YEAR`,
   `AMDSMI_DEFAULT_VARIANT`, `AMDSMI_MAX_NUM_POWER_PROFILES`, `AMDSMI_MAX_DRIVER_VERSION_LENGTH`.

- Unused member `year` in struct `amdsmi_version_t`.

- `amdsmi_io_link_type_t` has been replaced with `amdsmi_link_type_t`.
  - `amdsmi_io_link_type_t` is no longer needed as `amdsmi_link_type_t` is sufficient.
  - `amdsmi_link_type_t` enum has changed; primarily, the ordering of the PCI and XGMI types.
  - This change will also affect `amdsmi_link_metrics_t`, where the link_type field changes from `amdsmi_io_link_type_t` to `amdsmi_link_type_t`.

- `amdsmi_get_power_info_v2()`.
  - The ``amdsmi_get_power_info()`` has been unified and the v2 function is no longer needed or used.

- `AMDSMI_EVT_NOTIF_RING_HANG` event notification type in `amdsmi_evt_notification_type_t`.

- The `amdsmi_get_gpu_vram_info` now provides vendor names as a string.
  - `amdsmi_vram_vendor_type_t` enum structure is removed.
  - `amdsmi_vram_info_t` member named `amdsmi_vram_vendor_type_t` is changed to a character string.
  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_vram_info` now no longer requires decoding the vendor name as an enum.

- Backwards compatibility for `amdsmi_get_gpu_metrics_info()`'s,`jpeg_activity`and `vcn_activity` fields. Alternatively use `xcp_stats.jpeg_busy` or `xcp_stats.vcn_busy`. 
  - Backwards compatibility is removed for `jpeg_activity` and `vcn_activity` fields, if the `jpeg_busy` or `vcn_busy` field is available.
  - Providing both `vcn_activity`/`jpeg_activity` and XCP (partition) stats `vcn_busy`/`jpeg_busy` caused confusion about which field to use. By removing backward compatibility, it is easier to identify the relevant field.
  - The `jpeg_busy` field increased in size (for supported ASICs), making backward compatibility unable to fully copy the structure into `jpeg_activity`.

#### Optimized

- Reduced ``amd-smi`` CLI API calls needed to be called before reading or (re)setting GPU features. This
  improves overall runtime performance of the CLI.

- Removed partition information from the default `amd-smi static` CLI command.
  - Users can still retrieve the same data by calling `amd-smi`, `amd-smi static -p`, or `amd-smi partition -c -m`/`sudo amd-smi partition -a`.
  - Reading `current_compute_partition` may momentarily wake the GPU up. This is due to reading XCD registers, which is expected behavior. Changing partitions is not a trivial operation, `current_compute_partition` SYSFS controls this action.

- Optimized CLI command `amd-smi topology` in partition mode.
  - Reduced the number of `amdsmi_topo_get_p2p_status` API calls to one fourth.

#### Resolved issues

- Removed duplicated GPU IDs when receiving events using the `amd-smi event` command.

- Fixed `amd-smi monitor` decoder utilization (`DEC%`) not showing up on MI300 Series ASICs.

#### Known issues

- `amd-smi monitor` on Linux Guest systems triggers an attribute error.

### **HIP** 7.0.0

#### Added

* New HIP APIs
    - `hipLaunchKernelEx`  dispatches the provided kernel with the given launch configuration and forwards the kernel arguments.
    - `hipLaunchKernelExC`  launches a HIP kernel using a generic function pointer and the specified configuration.
    - `hipDrvLaunchKernelEx`  dispatches the device kernel represented by a HIP function object.
    - `hipMemGetHandleForAddressRange`  gets a handle for the address range requested.
    - `__reduce_add_sync`, `__reduce_min_sync`, and `__reduce_max_sync` functions added for aritimetic reduction across lanes of a warp, and `__reduce_and_sync`, `__reduce_or_sync`, and `__reduce_xor_sync` 
functions added for logical reduction. For details, see [Warp cross-lane functions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/how-to/hip_cpp_language_extensions.html#warp-cross-lane-functions).
* New support for Open Compute Project (OCP) floating-point `FP4`/`FP6`/`FP8` as follows. For details, see [Low precision floating point document](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/reference/low_fp_types.html).
    - Data types for `FP4`/`FP6`/`FP8`.
    - HIP APIs for `FP4`/`FP6`/`FP8`, which are compatible with corresponding CUDA APIs.
    - HIP Extensions APIs for microscaling formats, which are supported on AMD GPUs.
* New `wptr` and `rptr` values in `ClPrint`, for better logging in dispatch barrier methods.
* The `_sync()` version of crosslane builtins such as `shfl_sync()` are enabled by default. These can be disabled by setting the preprocessor macro `HIP_DISABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS`.
* Added `constexpr` operators for `fp16`/`bf16`.
* Added warp level primitives: `__syncwarp` and reduce intrinsics (e.g. `__reduce_add_sync()`).
* Support for the flags in APIs as following, now allows uncached memory allocation.
    - `hipExtHostRegisterUncached`, used in `hipHostRegister`.
    - `hipHostMallocUncached` and `hipHostAllocUncached`, used in `hipHostMalloc` and `hipHostAlloc`.
* `num_threads`  total number of threads in the group. The legacy API size is alias.
* Added PCI CHIP ID information as the device attribute.
* Added new tests applications for OCP data types `FP4`/`FP6`/`FP8`.
* A new attribute in HIP runtime was implemented which exposes a new device capability of how many compute dies (chiplets, xcc) are available on a given GPU. Developers can get this attribute via the API `hipDeviceGetAttribute`, to make use of the best cache locality in a kernel, and optimize the Kernel launch grid layout, for performance improvement.

#### Changed
* Some unsupported GPUs such as gfx9, gfx8 and gfx7 are deprecated on Microsoft Windows.
* Removal of beta warnings in HIP Graph APIs. All Beta warnings in usage of HIP Graph APIs are removed, they are now officially and fully supported.
* `warpSize` has changed. 
In order to match the CUDA specification, the `warpSize` variable is no longer `constexpr`. In general, this should be a transparent change; however, if an application was using `warpSize` as a compile-time constant, it will have to be updated to handle the new definition. For more information, see the discussion of `warpSize` within the [HIP C++ language extensions](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/how-to/hip_cpp_language_extensions.html#warpsize).
* Behavior changes
    - `hipGetLastError`  now returns the error code which is the last actual error caught in the current thread during the application execution.
    - Cooperative groups  in `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice` and `hipLaunchCooperativeKernel` functions, additional input parameter validation checks are added.
    - `hipPointerGetAttributes` returns `hipSuccess` instead of an error with invalid value `hipErrorInvalidValue`, in case `NULL` host or attribute pointer is passed as input parameter. It now matches the functionality of `cudaPointerGetAttributes` which changed with CUDA 11 and above releases.
    - `hipFree` previously there was an implicit wait which was applicable for all memory allocations, for synchronization purpose. This wait is now disabled for allocations made with `hipMallocAsync` and `hipMallocFromPoolAsync`, to match the behavior of CUDA API `cudaFree`.
    - `hipFreeAsync` now returns `hipSuccess` when the input pointer is NULL, instead of ` hipErrorInvalidValue` , to be consistent with `hipFree`.
    - Exceptions occurring during a kernel execution will not abort the process anymore but will return an error unless core dump is enabled.
* Changes in hipRTC.
    - Removal of `hipRTC` symbols from HIP Runtime Library.
    Any application using `hipRTC` APIs should link explicitly with the `hipRTC` library. This makes the usage of `hipRTC` library on Linux the same as on Windows and matches the behavior of CUDA `nvRTC`.
    - `hipRTC` compilation
    The device code compilation now uses namespace `__hip_internal`, instead of the standard headers `std`, to avoid namespace collision.
    - Changes of datatypes from `hipRTC`.
    Datatype definitions such as `int64_t`, `uint64_t`, `int32_t`, and `uint32_t`, etc. are removed to avoid any potential conflicts in some applications. HIP now uses internal datatypes instead, prefixed with `__hip`, for example, `__hip_int64_t`.
* HIP header clean up
    - Usage of STD headers, HIP header files only include necessary STL headers.
    - Deprecated structure `HIP_MEMSET_NODE_PARAMS` is removed. Developers can use the definition `hipMemsetParams` instead.
* API signature/struct changes
    - API signatures are adjusted in some APIs to match corresponding CUDA APIs. Impacted APIs are as folloing:
      * `hiprtcCreateProgram`
      * `hiprtcCompileProgram`
      * `hipMemcpyHtoD`
      * `hipCtxGetApiVersion`
    - HIP struct change in `hipMemsetParams`, it is updated and compatible with CUDA.
    - HIP vector constructor change in `hipComplex` initialization now generates correct values. The affected constructors will be small vector types such as `float2`, `int4`, etc.
* Stream Capture updates
    - Restricted stream capture mode, it is made in HIP APIs via adding the macro `CHECK_STREAM_CAPTURE_SUPPORTED ()`.
In the previous HIP enumeration `hipStreamCaptureMode`, three capture modes were defined. With checking in the macro, the only supported stream capture mode is now `hipStreamCaptureModeRelaxed`. The rest are not supported, and the macro will return `hipErrorStreamCaptureUnsupported`. This update involves the following APIs, which is allowed only in relaxed stream capture mode:
      * `hipMallocManaged`
      * `hipMemAdvise`
    - Checks stream capture mode, the following APIs check the stream capture mode and return error codes to match the behavior of CUDA.
      * `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
      * `hipEventQuery`
      * `hipStreamAddCallback`
    - Returns error during stream capture. The following HIP APIs now returns specific error `hipErrorStreamCaptureUnsupported` on the AMD platform, but not always `hipSuccess`, to match behavior with CUDA:
      * `hipDeviceSetMemPool`
      * `hipMemPoolCreate`
      * `hipMemPoolDestroy`
      * `hipDeviceSetSharedMemConfig`
      * `hipDeviceSetCacheConfig`
      * `hipMemcpyWithStream`
* Error code update
Returned error/value codes are updated in the following HIP APIs to match the corresponding CUDA APIs.
    - Module Management Related APIs:
      * `hipModuleLaunchKernel`
      * `hipExtModuleLaunchKernel`
      * `hipExtLaunchKernel`
      * `hipDrvLaunchKernelEx`
      * `hipLaunchKernel`
      * `hipLaunchKernelExC`
      * `hipModuleLaunchCooperativeKernel`
      * `hipModuleLoad`
    - Texture Management Related APIs:
The following APIs update the return codes to match the behavior with CUDA:
      * `hipTexObjectCreate`, supports zero width and height for 2D image. If either is zero, will not return `false`.
      * `hipBindTexture2D`, adds extra check, if pointer for texture reference or device is NULL, returns `hipErrorNotFound`.
      * `hipBindTextureToArray`, if any NULL pointer is input for texture object, resource descriptor, or texture descriptor, returns error `hipErrorInvalidChannelDescriptor`, instead of `hipErrorInvalidValue`.
      * `hipGetTextureAlignmentOffset`, adds a return code `hipErrorInvalidTexture` when the texture reference pointer is NULL.
    - Cooperative Group Related APIs, more calidations are added in the following API implementation:
      * `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
      * `hipLaunchCooperativeKernel`
* Invalid stream input parameter handling
In order to match the CUDA runtime behavior more closely, HIP APIs with streams passed as input parameters no longer check the stream validity. Previously, the HIP runtime returned an error code `hipErrorContextIsDestroyed` if the stream was invalid. In CUDA version 12 and later, the equivalent behavior is to raise a segmentation fault. HIP runtime now matches the CUDA by causing a segmentation fault. The list of APIs impacted by this change are as follows:
    - Stream Management Related APIs
      * `hipStreamGetCaptureInfo`
      * `hipStreamGetPriority`
      * `hipStreamGetFlags`
      * `hipStreamDestroy`
      * `hipStreamAddCallback`
      * `hipStreamQuery`
      * `hipLaunchHostFunc`
    - Graph Management Related APIs
      * `hipGraphUpload`
      * `hipGraphLaunch`
      * `hipStreamBeginCaptureToGraph`
      * `hipStreamBeginCapture`
      * `hipStreamIsCapturing`
      * `hipStreamGetCaptureInfo`
      * `hipGraphInstantiateWithParams`
    - Memory Management Related APIs
      * `hipMemcpyPeerAsync`
      * `hipMemcpy2DValidateParams`
      * `hipMallocFromPoolAsync`
      * `hipFreeAsync`
      * `hipMallocAsync`
      * `hipMemcpyAsync`
      * `hipMemcpyToSymbolAsync`
      * `hipStreamAttachMemAsync`
      * `hipMemPrefetchAsync`
      * `hipDrvMemcpy3D`
      * `hipDrvMemcpy3DAsync`
      * `hipDrvMemcpy2DUnaligned`
      * `hipMemcpyParam2D`
      * `hipMemcpyParam2DAsync`
      * `hipMemcpy2DArrayToArray`
      * `hipMemcpy2D`
      * `hipMemcpy2DAsync`
      * `hipDrvMemcpy2DUnaligned`
      * `hipMemcpy3D`
    - Event Management Related APIs
      * `hipEventRecord`
      * `hipEventRecordWithFlags`

#### Optimized

HIP runtime has the following functional improvements which improves runtime performance and user experience:

* Reduced usage of the lock scope in events and kernel handling.
    - Switches to `shared_mutex` for event validation, uses `std::unique_lock` in HIP runtime to create/destroy event, instead of `scopedLock`.
    - Reduces the `scopedLock` in handling of kernel execution. HIP runtime now calls `scopedLock` during kernel binary creation/initialization, doesn't call it again during kernel vector iteration before launch.
* Implementation of unifying managed buffer and kernel argument buffer so HIP runtime doesn't need to create/load a separate kernel argument buffer.
* Refactored memory validation, creates a unique function to validate a variety of memory copy operations.
* Improved kernel logging using demangling shader names.
* Advanced support for SPIRV, now kernel compilation caching is enabled by default. This feature is controlled by the environment variable `AMD_COMGR_CACHE`, for details, see [hip_rtc document](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/how-to/hip_rtc.html).
* Programmatic support for scratch limits on the AMD Instinct MI300 and MI350 Series up GPU devices. More enumeration values were added in `hipLimit_t` as following:
   - `hipExtLimitScratchMin`, minimum allowed value in bytes for scratch limit on the device.
   - `hipExtLimitScratchMax`, maximum allowed value in bytes for scratch limit on the device.
   - `hipExtLimitScratchCurrent`, current scratch limit threshold in bytes on the device. Must be between the value `hipExtLimitScratchMin` and `hipExtLimitScratchMax`.
 Developers can now use the environment variable `HSA_SCRATCH_SINGLE_LIMIT_ASYNC` to change the default allocation size with expected scratch limit in ROCR runtime. On top of it, this value can also be overwritten programmatically in the application using the HIP API `hipDeviceSetLimit(hipExtLimitScratchCurrent, value)` to reset the scratch limit value.
* HIP runtime now enables peer-to-peer (P2P) memory copies to utilize all available SDMA engines, rather than being limited to a single engine. It also selects the best engine first to give optimal bandwidth.
* Improved launch latency for `D2D` copies and `memset` on MI300 Series.
* Introduced a threshold to handle the command submission patch to the GPU device(s), considering the synchronization with CPU, for performance improvement.

#### Resolved issues

* Error of "unable to find modules" in HIP clean up for code object module.
* The issue of incorrect return error `hipErrorNoDevice`, when a crash occurred on GPU device due to illegal operation or memory violation. HIP runtime now handles the failure on the GPU side properly and reports the precise error code based on the last error seen on the GPU.
* Failures in some framework test applications, HIP runtime fixed the bug in retrieving a memory object from the IPC memory handle.
* A crash in TensorFlow related application. HIP runtime now combines multiple definitions of `callbackQueue` into a single function, in case of an exception, passes its handler to the application and provides corresponding error code.
* Fixed issue of handling the kernel parameters for the graph launch.
* Failures in roc-obj tools. HIP runtime now makes `DEPRECATED` message in roc-obj tools as `STDERR`.
* Support of `hipDeviceMallocContiguous` flags in `hipExtMallocWithFlags()`. It now enables `HSA_AMD_MEMORY_POOL_CONTIGUOUS_FLAG` in the memory pool allocation on GPU device.
* Compilation failure, HIP runtime refactored the vector type alignment with `__hip_vec_align_v`.
* A numerical error/corruption found in Pytorch  during graph replay. HIP runtime fixed the input sizes of kernel launch dimensions in hipExtModuleLaunchKernel for the execution of hipGraph capture.
* A crash during kernel execution in a customer application. The structure of kernel arguments was updated via adding the size of kernel arguments, and HIP runtime does validation before launch kernel with the structured arguments.
* Compilation error when using bfloat16 functions. HIP runtime removed the anonymous namespace from FP16 functions to resolve this issue.

#### Known issues

* `hipLaunchHostFunc` returns an error during stream capture. Any application using `hipLaunchHostFunc` might fail to capture graphs during stream capture, instead, it returns `hipErrorStreamCaptureUnsupported`.
* Compilation failure in kernels via hiprtc when using option `std=c++11`.

* ``HIPBLASLT_ORDER_COL16_4R16`` and ``HIPBLASLT_ORDER_COL16_4R8`` to ``hipblasLtOrder_t`` to support `FP16`/`BF16` swizzle GEMM and `FP8` / `BF8` swizzle GEMM respectively.
* TF32 emulation on gfx950.
* Support for `FP6`, `BF6`, and `FP4` on gfx950.
* Support for block scaling by setting `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_A_SCALE_MODE` and `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_B_SCALE_MODE` to `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_MATRIX_SCALE_VEC32_UE8M0`.

#### Changed

* The non-V2 APIs (``GemmPreference``, ``GemmProblemType``, ``GemmEpilogue``, ``GemmTuning``, ``GemmInputs``) in the cpp header are now the same as the V2 APIs (``GemmPreferenceV2``, ``GemmProblemTypeV2``, ``GemmEpilogueV2``, ``GemmTuningV2``, ``GemmInputsV2``). The original non-V2 APIs are removed.

#### Removed

* ``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_A_SCALE_POINTER_VEC_EXT`` and ``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_B_SCALE_POINTER_VEC_EXT`` are removed. Use the ``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_A_SCALE_MODE`` and ``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_B_SCALE_MODE`` attributes to set scalar (``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_MATRIX_SCALE_SCALAR_32F``) or vector (``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_MATRIX_SCALE_OUTER_VEC_32F``) attributes.
* The `hipblasltExtAMaxWithScale` API is removed.

#### Optimized

* Improved performance for 8-bit (`FP8` / `BF8` / `I8`) NN/NT cases by adding ``s_delay_alu`` to reduce stalls from dependent ALU operations on gfx12+.
* Improved performance for 8-bit and 16-bit (`FP16` / `BF16`) TN cases by enabling software dependency checks (Expert Scheduling Mode) under certain restrictions to reduce redundant hardware dependency checks on gfx12+.
* Improved performance for 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit batched GEMM with a better heuristic search algorithm for gfx942.

#### Upcoming changes

* V2 APIs (``GemmPreferenceV2``, ``GemmProblemTypeV2``, ``GemmEpilogueV2``, ``GemmTuningV2``, ``GemmInputsV2``) are deprecated.

### **hipCUB** (4.0.0)

#### Added

* A new cmake option, `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS`. When hipCUB is built with this option enabled, the `--offload-compress` switch is passed to the compiler. This causes the compiler to compress the binary that it generates. Compression can be useful in cases where you are compiling for a large number of targets, since this often results in a large binary. Without compression, in some cases, the generated binary may become so large that symbols are placed out of range, resulting in linking errors. The new `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` option is set to `ON` by default.
* Single pass operators in `agent/single_pass_scan_operators.hpp` which contains the following API:
  * `BlockScanRunningPrefixOp`
  * `ScanTileStatus`
  * `ScanTileState`
  * `ReduceByKeyScanTileState`
  * `TilePrefixCallbackOp`
* Support for gfx950.
* An overload of `BlockScan::InclusiveScan` that accepts an initial value to seed the scan.
* An overload of `WarpScan::InclusiveScan` that accepts an initial value to seed the scan.
* `UnrolledThreadLoad`, `UnrolledCopy`, and `ThreadLoadVolatilePointer` were added to align hipCUB with CUB.
* `ThreadStoreVolatilePtr` and the `IterateThreadStore` struct were added to align hipCUB with CUB.
* `hipcub::InclusiveScanInit` for CUB parity.

#### Changed

* The CUDA backend now requires CUB, Thrust, and libcu++ 2.7.0. If they aren't found, they will be downloaded from the CUDA CCCL repository.
* Updated `thread_load` and `thread_store` to align hipCUB with CUB.
* All kernels now have hidden symbol visibility. All symbols now have inline namespaces that include the library version, (for example, `hipcub::HIPCUB_300400_NS::symbol` instead of `hipcub::symbol`), letting the user link multiple libraries built with different versions of hipCUB.
* Modified the broadcast kernel in warp scan benchmarks. The reported performance may be different to previous versions.
* The `hipcub::detail::accumulator_t` in rocPRIM backend has been changed to utilise `rocprim::accumulator_t`.
* The usage of `rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op_t` has been replaced with `rocprim::accumulator_t`.

#### Removed

* The AMD GPU targets `gfx803` and `gfx900` are no longer built by default. If you want to build for these architectures, specify them explicitly in the `AMDGPU_TARGETS` cmake option.
* Deprecated `hipcub::AsmThreadLoad` is removed, use `hipcub::ThreadLoad` instead.
* Deprecated `hipcub::AsmThreadStore` is removed, use `hipcub::ThreadStore` instead.
* Deprecated `BlockAdjacentDifference::FlagHeads`, `BlockAdjacentDifference::FlagTails` and `BlockAdjacentDifference::FlagHeadsAndTails` have been removed.
* This release removes support for custom builds on gfx940 and gfx941.
* Removed C++14 support. Only C++17 is supported.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where `Sort(keys, compare_op, valid_items, oob_default)` in `block_merge_sort.hpp` would not fill in elements that are out of range (items after `valid_items`) with `oob_default`.
* Fixed an issue where `ScatterToStripedFlagged` in `block_exhange.hpp` was calling the wrong function.

#### Known issues

* `BlockAdjacentDifference::FlagHeads`, `BlockAdjacentDifference::FlagTails` and `BlockAdjacentDifference::FlagHeadsAndTails` have been removed from hipCUB's CUB backend. They were already deprecated as of version 2.12.0 of hipCUB and they were removed from CCCL (CUB) as of CCCL's 2.6.0 release.
* `BlockScan::InclusiveScan` for the CUDA backend does not compute the block aggregate correctly when passing an initial value parameter. This behavior is not matched by the AMD backend.

#### Upcoming changes

* `BlockAdjacentDifference::FlagHeads`, `BlockAdjacentDifference::FlagTails` and `BlockAdjacentDifference::FlagHeadsAndTails` were deprecated as of version 2.12.0 of hipCUB, and will be removed from the rocPRIM backend in a future release for the next ROCm major version (ROCm 7.0.0).

#### Added

* Support for gfx950.

#### Changed

* Deprecated the hipRAND Fortran API in favor of hipfort.
  
#### Removed

### **hipSOLVER** (3.0.0)

#### Added

* Added compatibility-only functions:
  * csrlsvqr
    * `hipsolverSpCcsrlsvqr`, `hipsolverSpZcsrlsvqr`

#### Resolved issues
  
* Corrected the value of `lwork` returned by various `bufferSize` functions to be consistent with CUDA cuSOLVER. The following functions now return `lwork` so that the workspace size (in bytes) is `sizeof(T) * lwork`, rather than `lwork`. To restore the original behavior, set the environment variable `HIPSOLVER_BUFFERSIZE_RETURN_BYTES`.
  * `hipsolverXorgbr_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXorgqr_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXorgtr_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXormqr_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXormtr_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXgesvd_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXgesvdj_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXgesvdBatched_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXgesvdaStridedBatched_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXsyevd_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXsyevdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXsyevj_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXsyevjBatched_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXsygvd_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXsygvdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXsygvj_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXsytrd_bufferSize`, `hipsolverXsytrf_bufferSize`.

### **hipSPARSE** (4.0.1)

#### Added

* `int8`, `int32`, and `float16` data types to `hipDataTypeToHCCDataType` so that sparse matrix descriptors can be used with them.
* Half float mixed precision to `hipsparseAxpby` where X and Y use `float16` and the result and compute type use `float`.
* Half float mixed precision to `hipsparseSpVV` where X and Y use `float16` and the result and compute type use `float`.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed a compilation [issue](https://github.com/ROCm/hipSPARSE/issues/555) related to using `std::filesystem` and C++14.
* Fixed an issue where the clients-common package was empty by moving the `hipsparse_clientmatrices.cmake` and `hipsparse_mtx2csr` files to it.

#### Known issues
  
* In `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`, the external buffer is passed as a parameter. This does not match the CUDA cuSPARSE API. This extra external buffer parameter will be removed in a future release. For now, this extra parameter can be ignored and nullptr passed in because it is unused internally.

### **hipSPARSELt** (0.2.4)

#### Added

* Support for the LLVM target gfx950.
* Support for the following data type combinations for the LLVM target gfx950:
  * `FP8`(E4M3) inputs, `F32` output, and `F32` Matrix Core accumulation.

* Compiler support of a new target-specific builtin `__builtin_amdgcn_processor_is` for late or deferred queries of the current target processor, and  `__builtin_amdgcn_is_invocable` to determine the current target processor ability to invoke a particular builtin. 
* HIPIFY support for CUDA 12.9.1 APIs. Added support for all new device and host APIs, including FP4, FP6, and FP128, and support for the corresponding ROCm HIP equivalents.

#### Changed

* Updated clang/llvm to AMD clang version 20.0.0 (equivalent to LLVM 20.0.0 with additional out-of-tree patches).
* HIPCC Perl scripts (`hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`) have been removed from this release.

#### Optimized

* Improved compiler memory load and store instructions. 

#### Upcoming changes

* `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE__` macro and HIP’s `warpSize` variable as `constexpr` are deprecated and will be disabled in a future release. Users are encouraged to update their code if needed to ensure future compatibility.

* rocMLIR fusion for kv-cache attention.
* Introduced a check for file-write errors.

#### Changed

### **MIVisionX** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* Support to enable/disable BatchPD code in VX_RPP extensions by checking the RPP_LEGACY_SUPPORT flag.

#### Changed

* VX_RPP extension: Version 3.1.0 release.
* Update the parameters and kernel API of Blur, Fog, Jitter, LensCorrection, Rain, Pixelate, Vignette and ResizeCrop wrt tensor kernels replacing the legacy BatchPD API calls in VX_RPP extensions.

### **RCCL** (2.26.6)

#### Added

* Support for the extended fine-grained system memory pool.
* Support for gfx950.
* Support for `unroll=1` in device-code generation to improve performance.
* Set a default of 112 channels for a single node with `8 * gfx950`.
* Enabled LL128 protocol on the gfx950.
* The ability to choose the unroll factor at runtime using `RCCL_UNROLL_FACTOR`. This can be set at runtime to 1, 2, or 4. This change currently increases compilation and linking time because it triples the number of kernels generated.
* Added MSCCL support for AllGather multinode on the gfx942 and gfx950 (for instance, 16 and 32 GPUs). To enable this feature, set the environment variable `RCCL_MSCCL_FORCE_ENABLE=1`. The maximum message size for MSCCL AllGather usage is `12292 * sizeof(datatype) * nGPUs`.
* Thread thresholds for LL/LL128 are selected in Tuning Models for the AMD Instinct MI300X. This impacts the number of channels used for AllGather and ReduceScatter. The channel tuning model is bypassed if `NCCL_THREAD_THRESHOLDS`, `NCCL_MIN_NCHANNELS`, or `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS` are set.
* Multi-node tuning for AllGather, AllReduce, and ReduceScatter that leverages LL/LL64/LL128 protocols to use nontemporal vector load/store for tunable message size ranges.
* LL/LL128 usage ranges for AllReduce, AllGather, and ReduceScatter are part of the tuning models, which enable architecture-specific tuning in conjunction with the existing Rome Models scheme in RCCL.
* Two new APIs are exposed as part of an initiative to separate RCCL code. These APIs are `rcclGetAlgoInfo` and `rcclFuncMaxSendRecvCount`. However, user-level invocation requires that RCCL be built with `RCCL_EXPOSE_STATIC` enabled.

#### Changed

* Compatibility with NCCL 2.23.4.
* Compatibility with NCCL 2.24.3.
* Compatibility with NCCL 2.25.1.
* Compatibility with NCCL 2.26.6.

* Fixed unit test failures in tests ending with the `ManagedMem` and `ManagedMemGraph` suffixes.
* Fixed a suboptimal algorithmic switching point for AllReduce on the AMD Instinct MI300X.
* Fixed broken functionality within the LL protocol on gfx950 by disabling inlining of LLGenericOp kernels.
* Fixed the known issue "When splitting a communicator using `ncclCommSplit` in some GPU configurations, MSCCL initialization can cause a segmentation fault" with a design change to use `comm` instead of `rank` for `mscclStatus`. The global map for `comm` to `mscclStatus` is still not thread safe but should be explicitly handled by mutexes for read-write operations. This is tested for correctness, but there is a plan to use a thread-safe map data structure in an upcoming release.

### **rocAL** (2.3.0)

#### Added
* Extended support to rocAL's video decoder to use rocDecode hardware decoder.

### **ROCm Bandwidth Test** (2.6.0)

#### Added

* Plugin architecture:
  * `rocm_bandwidth_test` is now the `framework` for individual `plugins` and features. The `framework` is available at: `/opt/rocm/bin/`

  * Individual `plugins`: The `plugins` (shared libraries) are available at: `/opt/rocm/lib/rocm_bandwidth_test/plugins/`

```{note}
Review the [README](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_bandwidth_test/blob/amd-mainline/README.md) file for details about the new options and outputs.
```

#### Changed

* The `CLI` and options/parameters have changed due to the new plugin architecture, where the plugin parameters are parsed by the plugin.

#### Removed

- The old CLI, parameters, and switches.

  * L2 to EA stalls per channel

* Roofline support for AMD Instinct MI350 Series GPUs.

##### Textual User Interface (TUI) (beta version)

* Text User Interface (TUI) support for analyze mode
  * A command line based user interface to support interactive single-run analysis.
  * To launch, use `--tui` option in analyze mode. For example, ``rocprof-compute analyze --tui``.

##### PC Sampling (beta version)

* Stochastic (hardware-based) PC sampling has been enabled for AMD Instinct MI300X Series and later GPUs.

* Host-trap PC Sampling has been enabled for AMD Instinct MI200 Series and later GPUs.

* Support for sorting of PC sampling by type: offset or count.

* PC Sampling Support on CLI and TUI analysis.

##### Roofline

* Support for Roofline plot on CLI (single run) analysis.

* `FP4` and `FP6` data types have been added for roofline profiling on AMD Instinct MI350 Series.

##### rocprofv3 support

* ``rocprofv3`` is supported as the default backend for profiling.
* Support to obtain performance information for all channels for TCC counters.
* Support for profiling on AMD Instinct MI 100 using ``rocprofv3``.
* Deprecation warning for ``rocprofv3`` interface in favor of the ROCprofiler-SDK interface, which directly accesses ``rocprofv3`` C++ tool.

##### Others

* Docker files to package the application and dependencies into a single portable and executable standalone binary file.

* Analysis report based filtering
  * ``-b`` option in profile mode now also accepts metric id(s) for analysis report based filtering.
  * ``-b`` option in profile mode also accepts hardware IP block for filtering; however, this filter support will be deprecated soon.
  * ``--list-metrics`` option added in profile mode to list possible metric id(s), similar to analyze mode.

* Support MEM chart on CLI (single run).

* ``--specs-correction`` option to provide missing system specifications for analysis.

#### Changed

* Changed the default ``rocprof`` version to ``rocprofv3``. This is used when environment variable ``ROCPROF`` is not set.
* Changed ``normal_unit`` default to ``per_kernel``.
* Decreased profiling time by not collecting unused counters in post-analysis.
* Updated Dash to >=3.0.0 (for web UI).
* Changed the condition when Roofline PDFs are generated during general profiling and ``--roof-only`` profiling (skip only when ``--no-roof`` option is present).
* Updated Roofline binaries:
  * Rebuild using latest ROCm stack.
  * Minimum OS distribution support minimum for roofline feature is now Ubuntu 22.04, RHEL 8, and SLES15 SP6.

#### Removed

* Roofline support for Ubuntu 20.04 and SLES below 15.6.
* Removed support for AMD Instinct MI50 and MI60.

#### Optimized

* ROCm Compute Profiler CLI has been improved to better display the GPU architecture analytics.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed kernel name and kernel dispatch filtering when using ``rocprofv3``.
* Fixed an issue of TCC channel counters collection in ``rocprofv3``.
* Fixed peak FLOPS of `F8`, `I8`, `F16`, and `BF16` on AMD Instinct MI300.
* Fixed not detecting memory clock issue when using ``amd-smi``.
* Fixed standalone GUI crashing.
* Fixed L2 read/write/atomic bandwidths on AMD Instinct MI350 Series.

#### Known issues

* On AMD Instinct MI100, accumulation counters are not collected, resulting in the following metrics failing to show up in the analysis: Instruction Fetch Latency, Wavefront Occupancy, LDS Latency.
  * As a workaround, use the environment variable ``ROCPROF=rocprof``, to use ``rocprof v1`` for profiling on AMD Instinct MI100.

* GPU id filtering is not supported when using ``rocprofv3``.

* Analysis of previously collected workload data will not work due to sysinfo.csv schema change.
  * As a workaround, re-run the profiling operation for the workload and interrupt the process after 10 seconds.
  Followed by copying the ``sysinfo.csv`` file from the new data folder to the old one.
  This assumes your system specification hasn't changed since the creation of the previous workload data.

* Analysis of new workloads might require providing shader/memory clock speed using
``--specs-correction`` operation if amd-smi or rocminfo does not provide clock speeds.

* Memory chart on ROCm Compute Profiler CLI might look corrupted if the CLI width is too narrow.

* Roofline feature is currently not functional on Azure Linux 3.0 and Debian 12.

#### Upcoming changes

* ``rocprof v1/v2/v3`` interfaces will be removed in favor of the ROCprofiler-SDK interface, which directly accesses ``rocprofv3`` C++ tool. Using ``rocprof v1/v2/v3`` interfaces will trigger a deprecation warning.
  * To use ROCprofiler-SDK interface, set environment variable `ROCPROF=rocprofiler-sdk` and optionally provide profile mode option ``--rocprofiler-sdk-library-path /path/to/librocprofiler-sdk.so``. Add ``--rocprofiler-sdk-library-path`` runtime option to choose the path to ROCprofiler-SDK library to be used.
* Hardware IP block based filtering using ``-b`` option in profile mode will be removed in favor of analysis report block based filtering using ``-b`` option in profile mode.
* MongoDB database support will be removed, and a deprecation warning has been added to the application interface.
* Usage of ``rocm-smi`` is deprecated in favor of ``amd-smi``, and a deprecation warning has been added to the application interface.

### **ROCm Data Center Tool** (1.1.0)

#### Added

* More profiling and monitoring metrics, especially for AMD Instinct MI300 and newer GPUs.
* Advanced logging and debugging options, including new log levels and troubleshooting guidance.

#### Changed

* Completed migration from legacy [ROCProfiler](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler/en/latest/) to [ROCprofiler-SDK](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/).
* Reorganized the configuration files internally and improved [README/installation](https://github.com/ROCm/rdc/blob/release/rocm-rel-7.0/README.md) instructions.
* Updated metrics and monitoring support for the latest AMD data center GPUs.

#### Optimized

- Integration with [ROCprofiler-SDK](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/) for performance metrics collection.
- Standalone and embedded operating modes, including streamlined authentication and configuration options.
- Support and documentation for diagnostic commands and GPU group management.
- [RVS](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ROCmValidationSuite/en/latest/) test integration and reporting.

### **ROCm SMI** (7.8.0)

#### Added

- Support for GPU metrics 1.8.  
  - Added new fields for `rsmi_gpu_metrics_t` including:  
    - Adding the following metrics to allow new calculations for violation status:
    - Per XCP metrics `gfx_below_host_limit_ppt_acc[XCP][MAX_XCC]` - GFX Clock Host limit Package Power Tracking violation counts.
    - Per XCP metrics `gfx_below_host_limit_thm_acc[XCP][MAX_XCC]` - GFX Clock Host limit Thermal (TVIOL) violation counts.
    - Per XCP metrics `gfx_low_utilization_acc[XCP][MAX_XCC]` - violation counts for how did low utilization caused the GPU to be below application clocks.
    - Per XCP metrics `gfx_below_host_limit_total_acc[XCP][MAX_XCC]`- violation counts for how long GPU was held below application clocks any limiter (see above new violation metrics).
  - Increasing available JPEG engines to 40.  
  Current ASICs may not support all 40. These will be indicated as UINT16_MAX or N/A in CLI.

#### Removed

- Removed backwards compatibility for `rsmi_dev_gpu_metrics_info_get()`'s `jpeg_activity` and `vcn_activity` fields. Alternatively use `xcp_stats.jpeg_busy` and `xcp_stats.vcn_busy`.
  - Backwards compatibility is removed for `jpeg_activity` and `vcn_activity` fields, if the `jpeg_busy` or `vcn_busy` field is available.
      - Providing both `vcn_activity`/`jpeg_activity` and XCP (partition) stats `vcn_busy`/`jpeg_busy` caused confusion for users about which field to use. By removing backward compatibility, it is easier to identify the relevant field.
      - The `jpeg_busy` field increased in size (for supported ASICs), making backward compatibility unable to fully copy the structure into `jpeg_activity`.

```{note}
See the full [ROCm SMI changelog](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib/blob/release/rocm-rel-7.0/CHANGELOG.md) for details, examples, and in-depth descriptions.

### **rocPRIM** (4.0.0)

#### Added

* Support for gfx950.
* `rocprim::accumulator_t` to ensure parity with CCCL.
* Test for `rocprim::accumulator_t`.
* `rocprim::invoke_result_r` to ensure parity with CCCL.
* Function `is_build_in` into `rocprim::traits::get`.
* Virtual shared memory as a fallback option in `rocprim::device_merge` when it exceeds shared memory capacity, similar to `rocprim::device_select`, `rocprim::device_partition`, and `rocprim::device_merge_sort`, which already include this feature.
* Initial value support to device level inclusive scans.
* New optimization to the backend for `device_transform` when the input and output are pointers.
* `LoadType` to `transform_config`, which is used for the `device_transform` when the input and output are pointers.
* `rocprim:device_transform` for n-ary transform operations API with as input `n` number of iterators inside a `rocprim::tuple`.
* `rocprim::key_value_pair::operator==`.
* The `rocprim::unrolled_copy` thread function to copy multiple items inside a thread.
* The `rocprim::unrolled_thread_load` function to load multiple items inside a thread using `rocprim::thread_load`.
* `rocprim::int128_t` and `rocprim::uint128_t` to benchmarks for improved performance evaluation on 128-bit integers.
* `rocprim::int128_t` to the supported autotuning types to improve performance for 128-bit integers.
* The `rocprim::merge_inplace` function for merging in-place.
* Initial value support for warp- and block-level inclusive scan.
* Support for building tests with device-side random data generation, making them finish faster. This requires rocRAND, and is enabled with the `WITH_ROCRAND=ON` build flag.
* Tests and documentation to `lookback_scan_state`. It is still in the `detail` namespace.

#### Changed

* Changed the parameters `long_radix_bits` and `LongRadixBits` from `segmented_radix_sort` to `radix_bits` and `RadixBits`, respectively.
* Marked the initialisation constructor of `rocprim::reverse_iterator<Iter>` `explicit`, use `rocprim::make_reverse_iterator`.
* Merged `radix_key_codec` into type_traits system.
* Renamed `type_traits_interface.hpp` to `type_traits.hpp`, rename the original `type_traits.hpp` to `type_traits_functions.hpp`.
* The default scan accumulator types for device-level scan algorithms have changed. This is a breaking change.
The previous default accumulator types could lead to situations in which unexpected overflow occurred, such as when the input or initial type was smaller than the output type. This is a complete list of affected functions and how their default accumulator types are changing:

  * `rocprim::inclusive_scan`
    * Previous default: `class AccType = typename std::iterator_traits<InputIterator>::value_type>`
    * Current default: `class AccType = rocprim::accumulator_t<BinaryFunction, typename std::iterator_traits<InputIterator>::value_type>`
  * `rocprim::deterministic_inclusive_scan`
    * Previous default: `class AccType = typename std::iterator_traits<InputIterator>::value_type>`
    * Current default: `class AccType = rocprim::accumulator_t<BinaryFunction, typename std::iterator_traits<InputIterator>::value_type>`
  * `rocprim::exclusive_scan`
    * Previous default: `class AccType = detail::input_type_t<InitValueType>>`
    * Current default: `class AccType = rocprim::accumulator_t<BinaryFunction, rocprim::detail::input_type_t<InitValueType>>`
  * `rocprim::deterministic_exclusive_scan`
    * Previous default: `class AccType = detail::input_type_t<InitValueType>>`
    * Current default: `class AccType = rocprim::accumulator_t<BinaryFunction, rocprim::detail::input_type_t<InitValueType>>`
* Undeprecated internal `detail::raw_storage`.
* A new version of `rocprim::thread_load` and `rocprim::thread_store` replaces the deprecated `rocprim::thread_load` and `rocprim::thread_store` functions. The versions avoid inline assembly where possible, and don't hinder the optimizer as much as a result.
* Renamed `rocprim::load_cs` to `rocprim::load_nontemporal` and `rocprim::store_cs` to `rocprim::store_nontemporal` to express the intent of these load and store methods better.
* All kernels now have hidden symbol visibility. All symbols now have inline namespaces that include the library version, for example, `rocprim::ROCPRIM_300400_NS::symbol` instead of `rocPRIM::symbol`, letting the user link multiple libraries built with different versions of rocPRIM.

#### Removed

* `rocprim::detail::float_bit_mask` and relative tests, use `rocprim::traits::float_bit_mask` instead.
* `rocprim::traits::is_fundamental`, use `rocprim::traits::get<T>::is_fundamental()` directly.
* The deprecated parameters `short_radix_bits` and `ShortRadixBits` from the `segmented_radix_sort` config. They were unused, it is only an API change.
* The deprecated `operator<<` from the iterators.
* The deprecated `TwiddleIn` and `TwiddleOut`. Use `radix_key_codec` instead.
* The deprecated flags API of `block_adjacent_difference`. Use `subtract_left()` or `block_discontinuity::flag_heads()` instead.
* The deprecated `to_exclusive` functions in the warp scans.
* The `rocprim::load_cs` from the `cache_load_modifier` enum. Use `rocprim::load_nontemporal` instead.
* The `rocprim::store_cs` from the `cache_store_modifier` enum. Use `rocprim::store_nontemporal` instead.
* The deprecated header file `rocprim/detail/match_result_type.hpp`. Include `rocprim/type_traits.hpp` instead. This header included:
  * `rocprim::detail::invoke_result`. Use `rocprim::invoke_result` instead.
  * `rocprim::detail::invoke_result_binary_op`. Use `rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op` instead.
  * `rocprim::detail::match_result_type`. Use `rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op_t` instead.
* The deprecated `rocprim::detail::radix_key_codec` function. Use `rocprim::radix_key_codec` instead.
* Removed `rocprim/detail/radix_sort.hpp`, functionality can now be found in `rocprim/thread/radix_key_codec.hpp`.
* Removed C++14 support. Only C++17 is supported.
* Due to the removal of `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE` in the compiler, the following deprecated warp size-related symbols have been removed:
  * `rocprim::device_warp_size()`
    * For compile-time constants, this is replaced with `rocprim::arch::wavefront::min_size()` and `rocprim::arch::wavefront::max_size()`. Use this when allocating global or shared memory.
    * For run-time constants, this is replaced with `rocprim::arch::wavefront::size().`
  * `rocprim::warp_size()`
    * Use `rocprim::host_warp_size()`, `rocprim::arch::wavefront::min_size()` or `rocprim::arch::wavefront::max_size()` instead.
  * `ROCPRIM_WAVEFRONT_SIZE`
    * Use `rocprim::arch::wavefront::min_size()` or `rocprim::arch::wavefront::max_size()` instead.
  * `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE`
    * This was a fallback define for the compiler's removed symbol, having the same name. 
* This release removes support for custom builds on gfx940 and gfx941.

#### Optimized

* Improved performance of `rocprim::device_select` and `rocprim::device_partition` when using multiple streams on the AMD Instinct MI300 Series.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where `device_batch_memcpy` reported benchmarking throughput being 2x lower than it was in reality.
* Fixed an issue where `device_segmented_reduce` reported autotuning throughput being 5x lower than it was in reality.
* Fixed device radix sort not returning the correct required temporary storage when a double buffer contains `nullptr`.
* Fixed constness of equality operators (`==` and `!=`) in `rocprim::key_value_pair`.
* Fixed an issue for the comparison operators in `arg_index_iterator` and `texture_cache_iterator`, where `<` and `>` comparators were swapped.
* Fixed an issue for the `rocprim::thread_reduce` not working correctly with a prefix value.

#### Known issues

* When using `rocprim::deterministic_inclusive_scan_by_key` and `rocprim::deterministic_exclusive_scan_by_key` the intermediate values can change order on Navi3x. However, if a commutative scan operator is used then the final scan value (output array) will still always be consistent between runs.

#### Upcoming changes

* `rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op` and `rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op_t` are deprecated. Use `rocprim::accumulator_t` instead.

### **rocPyDecode** (0.6.0)

#### Added

* ``rocpyjpegdecode`` package.
* ``src/rocjpeg`` source new subfolder.
* ``samples/rocjpeg`` new subfolder.

### **rocRAND** (4.0.0)

#### Added

* Support for gfx950.
* Additional unit tests for `test_log_normal_distribution.cpp`, `test_normal_distribution.cpp`, `test_rocrand_mtgp32_prng.cpp`, `test_rocrand_scrambled_sobol32_qrng.cpp`, `test_rocrand_scrambled_sobol64_qrng.cpp`, `test_rocrand_sobol32_qrng.cpp`, `test_rocrand_sobol64_qrng.cpp`, `test_rocrand_threefry2x32_20_prng.cpp`, `test_rocrand_threefry2x64_20_prng.cpp`, `test_rocrand_threefry4x32_20_prng.cpp`, `test_rocrand_threefry4x64_20_prng.cpp`, and `test_uniform_distribution.cpp`.
* New unit tests for `include/rocrand/rocrand_discrete.h` in `test_rocrand_discrete.cpp`, `include/rocrand/rocrand_mrg31k3p.h` in `test_rocrand_mrg31k3p_prng.cpp`, `include/rocrand/rocrand_mrg32k3a.h` in `test_rocrand_mrg32k3a_prng.cpp`, and `include/rocrand/rocrand_poisson.h` in `test_rocrand_poisson.cpp`.

#### Changed

* Changed the return type for `rocrand_generate_poisson` for the `SOBOL64` and `SCRAMBLED_SOBOL64` engines.
* Changed the unnecessarily large 64-bit data type for constants used for skipping in `MRG32K3A` to the 32-bit data type.
* Updated several `gfx942` auto tuning parameters.
* Modified error handling and expanded the error information for the case of double-deallocation of the (scrambled) sobol32 and sobol64 constants and direction vectors.

#### Removed

* Removed inline assembly and the `ENABLE_INLINE_ASM` CMake option. Inline assembly was used to optimize multiplication in the Mrg32k3a and Philox 4x32-10 generators. It is no longer needed because the current HIP compiler is able to produce code with the same or better performance.
* Removed instances of the deprecated clang definition `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE`.
* Removed C++14 support. Beginning with this release, only C++17 is supported.
* Directly accessing the (scrambled) sobol32 and sobol64 constants and direction vectors is no longer supported. For:
  * `h_scrambled_sobol32_constants`, use `rocrand_get_scramble_constants32` instead.
  * `h_scrambled_sobol64_constants`, use `rocrand_get_scramble_constants64` instead.
  * `rocrand_h_sobol32_direction_vectors`, use `rocrand_get_direction_vectors32` instead.
  * `rocrand_h_sobol64_direction_vectors`, use `rocrand_get_direction_vectors64` instead.
  * `rocrand_h_scrambled_sobol32_direction_vectors`, use `rocrand_get_direction_vectors32` instead.
  * `rocrand_h_scrambled_sobol64_direction_vectors`, use `rocrand_get_direction_vectors64` instead.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where `mt19937.hpp` would cause kernel errors during auto tuning.

#### Upcoming changes

* Deprecated the rocRAND Fortran API in favor of hipfort.

### **ROCr Debug Agent** (2.1.0)

#### Added

* The `-e` and `--precise-alu-exceptions` flags to enable precise ALU exceptions reporting on supported configurations.

### **ROCr Runtime** (1.18.0)

#### Added

* New API `hsa_amd_memory_get_preferred_copy_engine` to get preferred copy engine that can be used to when calling `hsa_amd_memory_async_copy_on_engine`.
* New API `hsa_amd_portable_export_dmabuf_v2` extension of existing `hsa_amd_portable_export_dmabuf` API to support new flags parameter. This allows specifying the new `HSA_AMD_DMABUF_MAPPING_TYPE_PCIE` flag when exporting dma-bufs.
* New flag `HSA_AMD_VMEM_ADDRESS_NO_REGISTER` adds support for new `HSA_AMD_VMEM_ADDRESS_NO_REGISTER` when calling `hsa_amd_vmem_address_reserve` API. This allows virtual address range reservations for SVM allocations to be tracked when running in ASAN mode.
* New sub query `HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_CLOCK_COUNTERS` returns a snapshot of the underlying driver's clock counters that can be used for profiling.

### **rocSHMEM** (3.0.0)

#### Added

* Reverse Offload conduit.
* New APIs: `rocshmem_ctx_barrier`, `rocshmem_ctx_barrier_wave`, `rocshmem_ctx_barrier_wg`, `rocshmem_barrier_all`, `rocshmem_barrier_all_wave`, `rocshmem_barrier_all_wg`, `rocshmem_ctx_sync`, `rocshmem_ctx_sync_wave`, `rocshmem_ctx_sync_wg`, `rocshmem_sync_all`, `rocshmem_sync_all_wave`, `rocshmem_sync_all_wg`, `rocshmem_init_attr`, `rocshmem_get_uniqueid`, and `rocshmem_set_attr_uniqueid_args`.
* `dlmalloc` based allocator.
* XNACK support.
* Support for initialization with MPI communicators other than `MPI_COMM_WORLD`.

#### Changed

* Changed collective APIs to use `_wg` suffix rather than `_wg_` infix.

#### Resolved issues

* Resolved segfault in `rocshmem_wg_ctx_create`, now provides `nullptr` if `ctx` cannot be created.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.30.0)

#### Added

* Hybrid computation support for existing STEQR routines.

#### Optimized

* Improved the performance of BDSQR and downstream functions, such as GESVD.
* Improved the performance of STEQR and downstream functions, such as SYEV/HEEV.
* Improved the performance of LARFT and downstream functions, such as GEQR2 and GEQRF.
  
#### Resolved issues

* Fixed corner cases that can produce NaNs in SYEVD for valid input matrices.

### **rocSPARSE** (4.0.2)

#### Added

* The `SpGEAM` generic routine for computing sparse matrix addition in CSR format.
* The `v2_SpMV` generic routine for computing sparse matrix vector multiplication. As opposed to the deprecated `rocsparse_spmv` routine, this routine does not use a fallback algorithm if a non-implemented configuration is encountered and will return an error in such a case. For the deprecated `rocsparse_spmv` routine, the user can enable warning messages in situations where a fallback algorithm is used by either calling the `rocsparse_enable_debug` routine upfront or exporting the variable `ROCSPARSE_DEBUG` (with the shell command `export ROCSPARSE_DEBUG=1`).
* Half float mixed precision to `rocsparse_axpby` where X and Y use `float16` and the result and compute type use `float`.
* Half float mixed precision to `rocsparse_spvv` where X and Y use `float16` and the result and compute type use `float`.
* Half float mixed precision to `rocsparse_spmv` where A and X use `float16` and Y and the compute type use `float`.
* Half float mixed precision to `rocsparse_spmm` where A and B use `float16` and C and the compute type use `float`.
* Half float mixed precision to `rocsparse_sddmm` where A and B use `float16` and C and the compute type use `float`.
* Half float uniform precision to the `rocsparse_scatter` and `rocsparse_gather` routines.
* Half float uniform precision to the `rocsparse_sddmm` routine.
* The `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_rowsplit` algorithm.
* Support for gfx950.
* ROC-TX instrumentation support in rocSPARSE (not available on Windows or in the static library version on Linux).
* The `almalinux` operating system name to correct the GFortran dependency.

#### Changed

* Switch to defaulting to C++17 when building rocSPARSE from source. Previously rocSPARSE was using C++14 by default.

#### Removed

* The deprecated `rocsparse_spmv_ex` routine.
* The deprecated `rocsparse_sbsrmv_ex`, `rocsparse_dbsrmv_ex`, `rocsparse_cbsrmv_ex`, and `rocsparse_zbsrmv_ex` routines.
* The deprecated `rocsparse_sbsrmv_ex_analysis`, `rocsparse_dbsrmv_ex_analysis`, `rocsparse_cbsrmv_ex_analysis`, and `rocsparse_zbsrmv_ex_analysis` routines.

#### Optimized

* Reduced the number of template instantiations in the library to further reduce the shared library binary size and improve compile times.
* Allow SpGEMM routines to use more shared memory when available. This can speed up performance for matrices with a large number of intermediate products.
* Use of the `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_adaptive` or `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_default` algorithms in `rocsparse_spmv` to perform transposed sparse matrix multiplication (`C=alpha*A^T*x+beta*y`) resulted in unnecessary analysis on A and needless slowdown during the analysis phase. This has been improved by skipping the analysis when performing the transposed sparse matrix multiplication.
* Improved the user documentation.

#### Resolved issues
  
* Fixed an issue in the public headers where `extern "C"` was not wrapped by `#ifdef __cplusplus`, which caused failures when building C programs with rocSPARSE.
* Fixed a memory access fault in the `rocsparse_Xbsrilu0` routines.
* Fixed failures that could occur in `rocsparse_Xbsrsm_solve` or `rocsparse_spsm` with BSR format when using host pointer mode.
* Fixed ASAN compilation failures.
* Fixed a failure that occurred when using const descriptor `rocsparse_create_const_csr_descr` with the generic routine `rocsparse_sparse_to_sparse`. The issue was not observed when using non-const descriptor `rocsparse_create_csr_descr` with `rocsparse_sparse_to_sparse`.
* Fixed a memory leak in the rocSPARSE handle.

#### Upcoming changes

* Deprecated the `rocsparse_spmv` routine. Use the `rocsparse_v2_spmv` routine instead.
* Deprecated the `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_stream` algorithm. Use the `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_rowsplit` algorithm instead.
* Deprecated the `rocsparse_itilu0_alg_sync_split_fusion` algorithm. Use one of `rocsparse_itilu0_alg_async_inplace`, `rocsparse_itilu0_alg_async_split`, or `rocsparse_itilu0_alg_sync_split` instead.

### **rocThrust** (4.0.0)

#### Added

* Additional unit tests for: binary_search, complex, c99math, catrig, ccosh, cexp, clog, csin, csqrt, and ctan.
* `test_param_fixtures.hpp` to store all the parameters for typed test suites.
* `test_real_assertions.hpp` to handle unit test assertions for real numbers.
* `test_imag_assertions.hpp` to handle unit test assertions for imaginary numbers.
* `clang++` is now used to compile google benchmarks on Windows.
* Support for gfx950.
* Merged changes from upstream CCCL/thrust 2.6.0.

#### Changed

* Updated the required version of Google Benchmark from 1.8.0 to 1.9.0.
* Renamed `cpp14_required.h` to `cpp_version_check.h`.
* Refactored `test_header.hpp` into `test_param_fixtures.hpp`, `test_real_assertions.hpp`, `test_imag_assertions.hpp`, and `test_utils.hpp`. This is done to prevent unit tests from having access to modules that they're not testing. This will improve the accuracy of code coverage reports.

#### Removed

* `device_malloc_allocator.h` has been removed. This header file was unused and should not impact users.
* Removed C++14 support. Only C++17 is now supported.
* `test_header.hpp` has been removed. The `HIP_CHECK` function, as well as the `test` and `inter_run_bwr` namespaces, have been moved to `test_utils.hpp`.
* `test_assertions.hpp` has been split into `test_real_assertions.hpp` and `test_imag_assertions.hpp`.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue with internal calls to unqualified `distance()` which would be ambiguous due to the visible implementation through ADL.

#### Known issues

* The order of the values being compared by `thrust::exclusive_scan_by_key` and `thrust::inclusive_scan_by_key` can change between runs when integers are being compared. This can cause incorrect output when a non-commutative operator such as division is being used.

#### Upcoming changes

* `thrust::device_malloc_allocator` is deprecated as of this version. It will be removed in an upcoming version.

### **rocWMMA** (2.0.0)

#### Added

* Internal register layout transforms to support interleaved MMA layouts.
* Support for the gfx950 target.
* Mixed input `BF8`/`FP8` types for MMA support.

* rocWMMA cooperative fragments register usage footprint has been reduced.
* rocWMMA fragments now support partial tile sizes with padding.

#### Removed

* Support for the gfx940 and gfx941 targets.
* The rocWMMA cooperative API.
* Wave count template parameters from transforms APIs.

#### Optimized

* Added internal flow control barriers to improve assembly code generation and overall performance.
* Enabled interleaved layouts by default in MMA to improve overall performance.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed a validation issue for small precision compute types `< B32` on gfx9.
* Fixed CMake validation of compiler support for `BF8`/`FP8` types.

### **RPP** (2.0.0)

#### Added

* Bitwise NOT, Bitwise AND, and Bitwise OR augmentations on HOST (CPU) and HIP backends.
* Tensor Concat augmentation on HOST (CPU) and HIP backends.
* JPEG Compression Distortion augmentation on HIP backend. 
* `log1p`, defined as `log (1 + x)`, tensor augmentation support on HOST (CPU) and HIP backends.
* JPEG Compression Distortion augmentation on HOST (CPU) backend. 

#### Changed

* Handle creation and destruction APIs have been consolidated. Use `rppCreate()` for handle initialization and `rppDestroy()` for handle destruction.
* The `logical_operations` function category has been renamed to `bitwise_operations`.
* TurboJPEG package installation enabled for RPP Test Suite with `sudo apt-get install libturbojpeg0-dev`. Instructions have been updated in utilities/test_suite/README.md.
* The `swap_channels` augmentation has been changed to `channel_permute`. `channel_permute` now also accepts a new argument, `permutationTensor` (pointer to an unsigned int tensor), that provides the permutation order to swap the RGB channels of each input image in the batch in any order:

    `RppStatus rppt_swap_channels_host(RppPtr_t srcPtr, RpptDescPtr srcDescPtr, RppPtr_t dstPtr, RpptDescPtr dstDescPtr, rppHandle_t rppHandle);`

    changed to:

    `RppStatus rppt_channel_permute_host(RppPtr_t srcPtr, RpptDescPtr srcDescPtr, RppPtr_t dstPtr, RpptDescPtr dstDescPtr, Rpp32u *permutationTensor , rppHandle_t rppHandle);`

#### Removed

* Older versions of RPP handle creation inlcuding `rppCreateWithBatchSize()`, `rppCreateWithStream()`, and `rppCreateWithStreamAndBatchSize()`. These have been replaced with `rppCreate()`.
* Older versions of RPP handle destruction API including `rppDestroyGPU()` and `rppDestroyHost()`. These have been replaced with `rppDestroy()`.

#### Resolved issues

* Test package - Debian packages will install required dependencies.

## ROCm 6.4.2

See the [ROCm 6.4.2 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.4.2/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (25.5.1)

#### Added

- Compute Unit Occupancy information per process.

- Support for getting the GPU Board voltage.

- New firmware PLDM_BUNDLE. `amd-smi firmware` can now show the PLDM Bundle on supported systems.

- `amd-smi ras --afid --cper-file <file_path>` to decode CPER records.

```

### **HIP** (6.4.2)

#### Added

* HIP API implementation for `hipEventRecordWithFlags`, records an event in the specified stream with flags.
* Support for the pointer attribute `HIP_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_CONTEXT`.
* Support for the flags `hipEventWaitDefault` and `hipEventWaitExternal`.

#### Optimized

* Improved implementation in `hipEventSynchronize`, HIP runtime now makes internal callbacks as non-blocking operations to improve performance.

#### Resolved issues

* Issue of dependency on `libgcc-s1` during rocm-dev install on Debian Buster. HIP runtime removed this Debian package dependency, and uses `libgcc1` instead for this distros.
* Building issue for `COMGR` dynamic load on Fedora and other Distros. HIP runtime now doesn't link against `libamd_comgr.so`.
* Failure in the API `hipStreamDestroy`, when stream type is `hipStreamLegacy`. The API now returns error code `hipErrorInvalidResourceHandle` on this condition.
* Kernel launch errors, such as `shared object initialization failed`, `invalid device function` or `kernel execution failure`. HIP runtime now loads `COMGR` properly considering the file with its name and mapped image.
* Memory access fault in some applications. HIP runtime fixed offset accumulation in memory address.
* The memory leak in virtual memory management (VMM). HIP runtime now uses the size of handle for allocated memory range instead of actual size for physical memory, which fixed the issue of address clash with VMM.
* Large memory allocation issue. HIP runtime now checks GPU video RAM and system RAM properly and sets size limits during memory allocation either on the host or the GPU device.
* Support of `hipDeviceMallocContiguous` flags in `hipExtMallocWithFlags()`. It now enables `HSA_AMD_MEMORY_POOL_CONTIGUOUS_FLAG` in the memory pool allocation on GPU device.
* Radom memory segmentation fault in handling `GraphExec` object release and `hipDeviceSyncronization`. HIP runtime now uses internal device synchronize function in `__hipUnregisterFatBinary`. 

### **hipBLASLt** (0.12.1)

#### Added

* Support for gfx1151 on Linux, complementing the previous support in the HIP SDK for Windows.

### **RCCL** (2.22.3)

#### Added

* Added support for the LL128 protocol on gfx942.

### **rocBLAS** (4.4.1)

#### Resolved issues

* rocBLAS might have failed to produce correct results for cherk/zherk on gfx90a/gfx942 with problem sizes k > 500 due to the imaginary portion on the C matrix diagonal not being zeros. rocBLAS now zeros the imaginary portion.

### **ROCm Compute Profiler** (3.1.1)

#### Added

* 8-bit floating point (FP8) metrics support for AMD Instinct MI300 GPUs.
* Additional data types for roofline: FP8, FP16, BF16, FP32, FP64, I8, I32, I64 (dependent on the GPU architecture).
* Data type selection option ``--roofline-data-type / -R`` for roofline profiling. The default data type is FP32.

#### Changed

* Changed dependency from `rocm-smi` to `amd-smi`.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed a crash related to Agent ID caused by the new format of the `rocprofv3` output CSV file.

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (1.0.2)

#### Optimized

* Improved readability of the OpenMP target offload traces by showing on a single Perfetto track.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed the file path to the script that merges Perfetto files from multi-process MPI runs. The script has also been renamed from `merge-multiprocess-output.sh` to `rocprof-sys-merge-output.sh`.

### **ROCm Validation Suite** (1.1.0)

#### Added

* NPS2/DPX and NPS4/CPX partition modes support for AMD Instinct MI300X.

### **rocPRIM** (3.4.1)

#### Upcoming changes

* Changes to the template parameters of warp and block algorithms will be made in an upcoming release.
* Due to an upcoming compiler change, the following symbols related to warp size have been marked as deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming major release:
    * `rocprim::device_warp_size()`. This has been replaced by `rocprim::arch::wavefront::min_size()` and `rocprim::arch::wavefront::max_size()` for compile-time constants. Use these when allocating global or shared memory. For run-time constants, use `rocprim::arch::wavefront::size()`.
  * `rocprim::warp_size()`
  * `ROCPRIM_WAVEFRONT_SIZE`

* The default scan accumulator types for device-level scan algorithms will be changed in an upcoming release, resulting in a breaking change. Previously, the default accumulator type was set to the input type for the inclusive scans and to the initial value type for the exclusive scans. This could lead to unexpected overflow if the input or initial type was smaller than the output type when the accumulator type wasn't explicitly set using the `AccType` template parameter. The new default accumulator types will be set to the type that results when the input or initial value type is applied to the scan operator.  

    The following is the complete list of affected functions and how their default accumulator types are changing:
    
    * `rocprim::inclusive_scan`
        * current default: `class AccType = typename std::iterator_traits<InputIterator>::value_type>`
        * future default: `class AccType = rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op_t<typename std::iterator_traits<InputIterator>::value_type, BinaryFunction>`
    * `rocprim::deterministic_inclusive_scan`
        * current default: `class AccType = typename std::iterator_traits<InputIterator>::value_type>`
        * future default: `class AccType = rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op_t<typename std::iterator_traits<InputIterator>::value_type, BinaryFunction>`
    * `rocprim::exclusive_scan`
        * current default: `class AccType = detail::input_type_t<InitValueType>>`
        * future default: `class AccType = rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op_t<rocprim::detail::input_type_t<InitValueType>, BinaryFunction>`
    * `rocprim::deterministic_exclusive_scan`
        * current default: `class AccType = detail::input_type_t<InitValueType>>`
        * future default: `class AccType = rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op_t<rocprim::detail::input_type_t<InitValueType>, BinaryFunction>`

* `rocprim::load_cs` and `rocprim::store_cs` are deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release. Alternatively, you can use `rocprim::load_nontemporal` and `rocprim::store_nontemporal` to load and store values in specific conditions (like bypassing the cache) for `rocprim::thread_load` and `rocprim::thread_store`.

### **rocSHMEM** (2.0.1)

#### Resolved issues

* Incorrect output for `rocshmem_ctx_my_pe` and `rocshmem_ctx_n_pes`.
* Multi-team errors by providing team specific buffers in `rocshmem_ctx_wg_team_sync`.
* Missing implementation of `rocshmem_g` for IPC conduit.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.28.2)

#### Added

* Hybrid computation support for existing routines, such as STERF.
* SVD for general matrices based on Cuppen's Divide and Conquer algorithm:
    - GESDD (with batched and strided\_batched versions)

#### Optimized

* Reduced the device memory requirements for STEDC, SYEVD/HEEVD, and SYGVD/HEGVD.
* Improved the performance of STEDC and divide and conquer Eigensolvers.
* Improved the performance of SYTRD, the initial step of the Eigensolvers that start with the tridiagonalization of the input matrix.

## ROCm 6.4.1

See the [ROCm 6.4.1 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.4.1/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (25.4.2)

#### Added

* Dumping CPER entries from RAS tool `amdsmi_get_gpu_cper_entries()` to Python and C APIs.
  - Dumping CPER entries consist of `amdsmi_cper_hdr_t`.
  - Dumping CPER entries is also enabled in the CLI interface through `sudo amd-smi ras --cper`.
* `amdsmi_get_gpu_busy_percent` to the C API.

#### Changed

* Modified VRAM display for `amd-smi monitor -v`. 

#### Optimized

* Improved load times for CLI commands when the GPU has multiple partitions.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed partition enumeration in `amd-smi list -e`, `amdsmi_get_gpu_enumeration_info()`, `amdsmi_enumeration_info_t`, `drm_card`, and `drm_render` fields.

#### Known issues

* When using the `--follow` flag with `amd-smi ras --cper`, CPER entries are not streamed continuously as intended. This will be fixed in an upcoming ROCm release.

> [!NOTE]
> See the full [AMD SMI changelog](https://github.com/ROCm/amdsmi/blob/release/rocm-rel-6.4/CHANGELOG.md) for details, examples, and in-depth descriptions.

### **HIP** (6.4.1)

#### Added

* New log mask enumeration `LOG_COMGR` enables logging precise code object information.

#### Changed

* HIP runtime uses device bitcode before SPIRV.
* The implementation of preventing `hipLaunchKernel` latency degradation with number of idle streams is reverted or disabled by default.

#### Optimized

* Improved kernel logging includes de-mangling shader names.
* Refined implementation in HIP APIs `hipEventRecords` and `hipStreamWaitEvent` for performance improvement.

#### Resolved issues

* Stale state during the graph capture. The return error was fixed, HIP runtime now always uses the latest dependent nodes during `hipEventRecord` capture.
* Segmentation fault during kernel execution. HIP runtime now allows maximum stack size as per ISA on the GPU device.

### **hipBLASLt** (0.12.1)

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an accuracy issue for some solutions using an `FP32` or `TF32` data type with a TT transpose.

### **RCCL** (2.22.3)

#### Changed

* MSCCL++ is now disabled by default. To enable it, set `RCCL_MSCCLPP_ENABLE=1`.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where early termination, in rare circumstances, could cause the application to stop responding by adding synchronization before destroying a proxy thread.
* Fixed the accuracy issue for the MSCCLPP `allreduce7` kernel in graph mode.

#### Known issues

* When splitting a communicator using `ncclCommSplit` in some GPU configurations, MSCCL initialization can cause a segmentation fault. The recommended workaround is to disable MSCCL with `export RCCL_MSCCL_ENABLE=0`.
  This issue will be fixed in a future ROCm release.

* Within the RCCL-UnitTests test suite, failures occur in tests ending with the
  `.ManagedMem` and `.ManagedMemGraph` suffixes. These failures only affect the
  test results and do not affect the RCCL component itself. This issue will be
  resolved in a future ROCm release.

### **rocALUTION** (3.2.3)

#### Added

* The `-a` option has been added to the `rmake.py` build script. This option allows you to select specific architectures when building on Microsoft Windows.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where the `HIP_PATH` environment variable was being ignored when compiling on Microsoft Windows.

### **ROCm SMI** (7.5.0)

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed partition enumeration. It now refers to the correct DRM Render and Card paths.

> [!NOTE]
> See the full [ROCm SMI changelog](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib/blob/release/rocm-rel-6.4/CHANGELOG.md) for details, examples, and in-depth descriptions.

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (1.0.1)

## ROCm 6.4.0

See the [ROCm 6.4.0 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.4.0/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

- Removed initialization requirements for `amdsmi_get_lib_version()` and added `amdsmi_get_rocm_version()` to the Python API & CLI.

- Added an additional argument `sensor_ind` to `amdsmi_get_power_info()`.
  - This change breaks previous C API calls and will require a change.
  - Python API now accepts `sensor_ind` as an optional argument. This does not impact previous usage.

- Deprecated enum `AMDSMI_NORMAL_STRING_LENGTH` in favor of `AMDSMI_MAX_STRING_LENGTH`.

- Changed to use thread local mutex by default.
  - Most `sysfs` reads do not require cross-process level mutex and writes to `sysfs` should be protected by the kernel already.
  - Users can still switch to the old behavior by setting the environment variable `AMDSMI_MUTEX_CROSS_PROCESS=1`.

- Changed `amdsmi_vram_vendor_type_t` enum names impacting the `amdsmi_vram_info_t` structure. This change also impacts the usage of the `vram_vendor` output of `amdsmi_get_gpu_vram_info()`.

- Changed the `amdsmi_nps_caps_t` struct impacting `amdsmi_memory_partition_config_t`, `amdsmi_accelerator_partition_t`, `amdsmi_accelerator_partition_profile_config_t`.
  Affected functions are:

  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_memory_partition_config()`

  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile()`

- Corrected CLI CPU argument name. `--cpu-pwr-svi-telemtry-rails` is now `--cpu-pwr-svi-telemetry-rails`.

- Added amdgpu driver version and amd_hsmp driver version to the `amd-smi version` command.

- All `amd-smi set` and `amd-smi reset` options are now mutually exclusive. You can now only use one `set` option as a time.

- Changed the name of the `power` field to `energy_accumulator` in the Python API for `amdsmi_get_energy_count()`.

- Added violation status output for Graphics Clock Below Host Limit to `amd-smi` CLI: `amdsmi_get_violation_status()`, `amd-smi metric  --throttle`, and `amd-smi monitor --violation`.
  Users can retrieve violation status through either our Python or C++ APIs. Only available for MI300 Series+ ASICs.

- Updated API `amdsmi_get_violation_status()` structure and CLI `amdsmi_violation_status_t` to include GFX Clk below host limit.

- Updated API `amdsmi_get_gpu_vram_info()` structure and CLI `amd-smi static --vram`.

#### Removed

#### Optimized

- Added additional help information to `amd-smi set --help` command. The subcommands now detail what values are accepted as input.

- Modified `amd-smi` CLI to allow case insensitive arguments if the argument does not begin with a single dash.

- Converted `xgmi` read and write from KBs to dynamically selected readable units.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info` and `amd-smi static --asic` not displaying graphics version correctly for Instinct MI200 Series, Instinct MI100 Series, and RDNA3-based GPUs.

#### Known issues

- AMD SMI only reports 63 GPU devices when setting CPX on all 8 GPUs. When setting CPX as a partition mode, there is a DRM node limitation of 64.

This is a known limitation of the Linux kernel; not the driver. Other drivers, such as those using PCIe space (for example, `ast`), might occupy the necessary DRM nodes.  You can check the number of DRM nodes using `ls /sys/class/drm`.

Some workaround options are as follows:

  - Remove other devices occupying DRM nodes.

    Recommended steps for removing unnecessary drivers:

    1. Unload amdgpu - `sudo rmmod amdgpu`.

    2. Remove unnecessary driver(s) - ex. `sudo rmmod ast`.

    3. Reload amgpu - `sudo modprobe amdgpu`.

    4. Confirm `amd-smi list` reports all nodes (this can vary per MI ASIC).

  - Update your OS kernel.

  - Build and install your own kernel.

#### Upcoming changes

- The `AMDSMI_LIB_VERSION_YEAR` enum and API fields will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

- The `pasid` field in struct `amdsmi_process_info_t` will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

### **HIP** (6.4.0)

#### Added

* New HIP APIs

    - `hipDeviceGetTexture1DLinearMaxWidth`  returns the maximum width of elements in a 1D linear texture, which can be allocated on the specified device.
    - `hipStreamBatchMemOp`  enqueues an array of batch memory operations in the stream, for stream synchronization.
    - `hipGraphAddBatchMemOpNode`  creates a batch memory operation node and adds it to a graph.
    - `hipGraphBatchMemOpNodeGetParams`  returns the pointer of parameters from the batch memory operation node.
    - `hipGraphBatchMemOpNodeSetParams`  sets parameters for the batch memory operation node.
    - `hipGraphExecBatchMemOpNodeSetParams`  sets the parameters for a batch memory operation node in the given executable graph.
    - `hipLinkAddData` adds SPIR-V code object data to linker instance with options.
    - `hipLinkAddFile` adds SPIR-V code object file to linker instance with options.
    - `hipLinkCreate`  creates linker instance at runtime with options.
    - `hipLinkComplete` completes linking of program and output linker binary to use with hipModuleLoadData.
    - `hipLinkDestroy`  deletes linker instance.

#### Changed

* `roc-obj` tools is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release.

    - Perl package installation is not required, and users will need to install this themselves if they want to.
    - Support for ROCm Object tooling has moved into `llvm-objdump` provided by package `rocm-llvm`.

* SDMA retainer logic is removed for engine selection in operation of runtime buffer copy.

#### Optimized

* `hipGraphLaunch` parallelism is improved for complex data-parallel graphs.
* Make the round-robin queue selection in command scheduling. For multi-streams execution, HSA queue from null stream lock is freed and won't occupy the queue ID after the kernel in the stream is finished.
* The HIP runtime doesn't free bitcode object before code generation. It adds a cache, which allows compiled code objects to be reused instead of recompiling. This improves performance on multi-GPU systems.
* Runtime now uses unified copy approach:

    - Unpinned `H2D` copies are no longer blocking until the size of 1 MB.
    - Kernel copy path is enabled for unpinned `H2D`/`D2H` methods.
    - The default environment variable `GPU_FORCE_BLIT_COPY_SIZE` is set to `16`, which limits the kernel copy to sizes less than 16 KB, while copies larger than that would be handled by `SDMA` engine.
    - Blit code is refactored, and ASAN instrumentation is cleaned up.

#### Resolved issues

* Out-of-memory error on Microsoft Windows. When the user calls `hipMalloc` for device memory allocation while specifying a size larger than the available device memory, the HIP runtime fixes the error in the API implementation, allocating the available device memory plus system memory (shared virtual memory).
* Error of dependency on `libgcc-s1` during rocm-dev install on Debian Buster. HIP runtime now uses `libgcc1` for this distros.
* Stack corruption during kernel execution. HIP runtime now adds a maximum stack size limit based on the GPU device feature. 

#### Upcoming changes

The following lists the backward incompatible changes planned for upcoming major ROCm releases.

* Signature changes in APIs to correspond with NVIDIA CUDA APIs,

    - `hiprtcCreateProgram`
    - `hiprtcCompileProgram`
    - `hipCtxGetApiVersion`

* Behavior of `hipPointerGetAttributes` is changed to match corresponding CUDA API in version 11 and later releases.
* Return error/value code updates in the following hip APIs to match the corresponding CUDA APIs,

    - `hipModuleLaunchKernel`
    - `hipExtModuleLaunchKernel`
    - `hipModuleLaunchCooperativeKernel`
    - `hipGetTextureAlignmentOffset`
    - `hipTexObjectCreate`
    - `hipBindTexture2D`
    - `hipBindTextureToArray`
    - `hipModuleLoad`
    - `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
    - `hipExtLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`

* HIPRTC implementation, the compilation of `hiprtc` now uses  namespace ` __hip_internal`, instead of the standard headers `std`.
* Stream capture mode updates in the following HIP APIs. Streams can only be captured in relax mode, to match the behavior of the corresponding CUDA APIs,

   - `hipMallocManaged`
   - `hipMemAdvise`
   - `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
   - `hipDeviceSetCacheConfig`
   - `hipDeviceSetSharedMemConfig`
   - `hipMemPoolCreate`
   - `hipMemPoolDestory`
   - `hipDeviceSetMemPool`
   - `hipEventQuery`

* The implementation of `hipStreamAddCallback` is updated, to match the behavior of CUDA.
* Removal of `hiprtc` symbols from hip library.

    - `hiprtc` will be a independent library, and all symbols supported in HIP library are removed.
    - Any application using `hiprtc` APIs should link explicitly with `hiprtc` library.
    - This change makes the use of `hiprtc` library on Linux the same as on Windows, and matches the behavior of CUDA `nvrtc`.

* Removal of deprecated struct `HIP_MEMSET_NODE_PARAMS`, Developers can use definition `hipMemsetParams` instead.

### **hipBLAS** (2.4.0)

#### Changed

* Updated the build dependencies.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed multi-threads bug.
* Fixed multi-streams bug.

### **hipCUB** (3.4.0)

#### Added

* Added regression tests to `rtest.py`. These tests recreate scenarios that have caused hardware problems in past emulation environments. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run these tests.
* Added extended tests to `rtest.py`. These tests are extra tests that did not fit the criteria of smoke and regression tests. These tests will take much longer than smoke and regression tests. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run these tests.
* Added `ForEach`, `ForEachN`, `ForEachCopy`, `ForEachCopyN` and `Bulk` functions to have parity with CUB.
* Added the `hipcub::CubVector` type for CUB parity.
* Added `--emulation` option for `rtest.py`
* Unit tests can be run with `[--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=<test_name>;`.
* Added `DeviceSelect::FlaggedIf` and its inplace overload.
* Added CUB macros missing from hipCUB: `HIPCUB_MAX`, `HIPCUB_MIN`, `HIPCUB_QUOTIENT_FLOOR`, `HIPCUB_QUOTIENT_CEILING`, `HIPCUB_ROUND_UP_NEAREST` and `HIPCUB_ROUND_DOWN_NEAREST`.
* Added `hipcub::AliasTemporaries` function for CUB parity.

#### Changed

* Removed usage of `std::unary_function` and `std::binary_function` in `test_hipcub_device_adjacent_difference.cpp`.
* Changed the subset of tests that are run for smoke tests such that the smoke test will complete with faster run time and never exceed 2 GB of VRAM usage. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* The `rtest.py` options have changed. `rtest.py` is now run with at least either `--test|-t` or `--emulation|-e`, but not both options.
* The NVIDIA backend now requires CUB, Thrust, and libcu++ 2.5.0. If it is not found, it will be downloaded from the NVIDIA CCCL repository.
* Changed the C++ version from 14 to 17. C++14 will be deprecated in the next major release.

#### Known issues

* When building on Microsoft Windows using HIP SDK for ROCm 6.4, ``hipMalloc`` returns ``hipSuccess`` even when the size passed to it is too large and the allocation fails. Because of this, limits have been set for the maximum test case sizes for some unit tests such as HipcubDeviceRadixSort&#39;s SortKeysLargeSizes .

### **hipFFT** (1.0.18)

#### Added

* Implemented the `hipfftMpAttachComm`, `hipfftXtSetDistribution`, and `hipfftXtSetSubformatDefault` APIs to allow
  computing FFTs that are distributed between multiple MPI (Message Passing Interface) processes.  These APIs can be enabled
  with the `HIPFFT_MPI_ENABLE` CMake option, which defaults to `OFF`. The backend FFT library called by hipFFT must support MPI for these APIs to work.

  The backend FFT library called by hipFFT must support MPI for these APIs to work.

#### Changed

* Building with the address sanitizer option sets xnack+ for the relevant GPU
  architectures.
* Use the `find_package` CUDA toolkit instead of CUDA in CMake for modern CMake compatibility.

#### Resolved issues
* `MIOpen` support in hipify-perl under the `-miopen` option
* Use `const_cast<const char**>` for the last arguments in the `hiprtcCreateProgram` and `hiprtcCompileProgram` function calls, as in CUDA, they are of the `const char* const*` type
* Support for `fp16` device/host API. For more information see [#1769](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/issues/1769) in the HIPIFY Github repository.
* Fixed instructions on building LLVM for HIPIFY on Linux. For more information see [#1800](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/issues/1800) in the HIPIFY Github repository.

#### Known issues

* `hipify-clang` build failure against LLVM 15-18 on `Ubuntu`, `CentOS`, and `Fedora`. For more information see [#833](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/issues/833) in the HIPIFY Github repository.

### **hipRAND** (2.12.0)

#### Changed

* When building hipRAND on Windows, use `HIP_PATH` (instead of the former `HIP_DIR`) to specify the path to the HIP SDK installation.
* When building with the `rmake.py` script, `HIP_PATH` will default to `C:\hip` if it is not set.
  
#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue causing hipRAND build failures on Windows when the HIP SDK was installed in a location with a path that contains spaces.

### **hipSOLVER** (2.4.0)

#### Added

* The `csrlsvqr` compatibility-only functions `hipsolverSpScsrlsvqr`, `hipsolverSpDcsrlsvqr`, `hipsolverSpCcsrlsvqr`, `hipsolverSpZcsrlsvqr`

### **hipSPARSE** (3.2.0)

#### Resolved issues

* For a CMake bug workaround, set `CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH` when `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` is unset.

#### Upcoming changes
 
* hipTensor will enhance performance and usability while unifying the API design across all operations (elementwise, reductions, and tensor contractions), enabling consistent multi-stage execution and plan reuse. As part of this change, the API functions `hiptensorInitTensorDescriptor`, `hiptensorContractionDescriptor_t` , `hiptensorInitContractionDescriptor`, `hiptensorInitContractionFind`, `hiptensorContractionGetWorkspaceSize`, `hiptensorInitContractionPlan`, `hiptensorContraction`, `hiptensorElementwiseBinary`, `hiptensorElementwiseTrinary`, `hiptensorPermutation`, and `hiptensorReduction` will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

### **llvm-project** (19.0.0)

#### Added

* Support for `amdgpu_max_num_work_groups` in the compiler. This attribute
  can be set by end users or library developers. It provides an upper limit
  for workgroups as described in [AMD GPU Attributes](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#amdgpu-max-num-work-groups).
  When set, the AMDGPU target backend might produce better machine code.

#### Changed

* The name reported for detected agents is now based on the `amdgpu.ids` database provided by `libdrm`.

### **rocDecode** (0.10.0)

#### Added

* The new bitstream reader feature has been added. The bitstream reader contains built-in stream file parsers, including an elementary stream file parser and an IVF container file parser. The reader can parse AVC, HEVC, and AV1 elementary stream files, and AV1 IVF container files. Additional supported formats will be added.
* VP9 support has been added.
* More CTests have been added: VP9 test and tests on video decode raw sample.
* Two new samples, videodecoderaw and videodecodepicfiles, have been added. videodecoderaw uses the bitstream reader instead of the FFMPEG demuxer to get picture data, and videodecodepicfiles shows how to decode an elementary video stream stored in multiple files, with each file containing bitstream data of a coded picture.

#### Changed

* AMD Clang++ is now the default CXX compiler.
* Moved MD5 code out of the RocVideoDecode utility.

#### Removed

* FFMPEG executable requirement for the package.

### **rocFFT** (1.0.32)

#### Changed

#### Removed

* Ahead-of-time compiled kernels for the gfx906, gfx940, and gfx941 architectures. These architectures still work the same way, but their kernels are now compiled at runtime.
* Consumer GPU architectures from the precompiled kernel cache that ships with
  rocFFT. rocFFT continues to ship with a cache of precompiled RTC kernels for data center
  and workstation architectures. As before, user-level caches can be enabled by setting the
  environment variable `ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH` to a writeable file location.

#### Optimized

* Improved MPI transform performance by using all-to-all communication for global transpose operations.  
  Point-to-point communications are still used when all-to-all is unavailable.
* Improved the performance of unit-strided, complex interleaved, forward, and inverse length (64,64,64) FFTs.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed incorrect results from 2-kernel 3D FFT plans that used non-default output strides. For more information, see the [rocFFT GitHub issue](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT/issues/507).

> See the full [ROCm SMI changelog](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib/blob/release/rocm-rel-6.4/CHANGELOG.md) for details, examples, and in-depth descriptions.

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (1.0.0)

#### Added 

- Support for VA-API and rocDecode tracing.
- Aggregation of MPI data collected across distributed nodes and ranks. The data is concatenated into a single proto file.

#### Changed
- Backend refactored to use [ROCprofiler-SDK](https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-sdk) rather than [ROCProfiler](https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler) and [ROCTracer](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCTracer).

### **ROCm Validation Suite** (1.1.0)

#### Added

* Configuration files for MI210.
* Support for OCP fp8 data type.
* GPU index-based CLI execution.

#### Changed

* JSON logging with updated schema.

### **rocPRIM** (3.4.0)

#### Added

* The parallel `find_first_of` device function with autotuned configurations has been added. This function is similar to `std::find_first_of`. It searches for the first occurrence of any of the provided elements.
* Tuned configurations for segmented radix sort for gfx942 have been added to improve performance on the gfx942 architecture.
* The parallel device-level function, `rocprim::adjacent_find`, which is similar to the C++ Standard Library `std::adjacent_find` algorithm, has been added.
* Configuration autotuning has been added to device adjacent find (`rocprim::adjacent_find`) for improved performance on selected architectures.
* `rocprim::numeric_limits` has been added. This is an extension of `std::numeric_limits` that supports 128-bit integers.
* `rocprim::int128_t` and `rocprim::uint128_t` have been added. 
* The parallel `search` and `find_end` device functions have been added. These are similar to `std::search` and `std::find_end`. These functions search for the first and last occurrence of the sequence, respectively.
* A parallel device-level function, `rocprim::search_n`, has been added. `rocprim::search_n` is similar to the C++ Standard Library `std::search_n` algorithm.
* New constructors, a `base` function, and a `constexpr` specifier have been added to all functions in `rocprim::reverse_iterator` to improve parity with the C++17 `std::reverse_iterator`.
* hipGraph support has been added to the device run-length-encode for non-trivial runs (`rocprim::run_length_encode_non_trivial_runs`).
* Configuration autotuning has been added to the device run-length-encode for non-trivial runs (`rocprim::run_length_encode_non_trivial_runs`) for improved performance on selected architectures.
* Configuration autotuning has been added to the device run-length-encode for trivial runs (`rocprim::run_length_encode`) for improved performance on selected architectures.
* The `--emulation` option has been added to `rtest.py`. Unit tests can be run with `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=<test_name>`.
* Extended and regression tests have been added to `rtest.py`. Extended tests are tests that don't fit the criteria of smoke or regression tests, and take longer than smoke or regression tests to run. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run extended tests, and `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run regression tests.
* Added a new type traits interface to enable users to provide additional type trait information to rocPRIM, facilitating better compatibility with custom types.

#### Changed

* Changed the subset of tests that are run for smoke tests such that the smoke test will complete faster and never exceed 2 GB of VRAM usage. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* The `rtest.py` options have changed. `rtest.py` is now run with at least either `--test|-t` or `--emulation|-e`, but not both options.
* Changed the internal algorithm of block radix sort to use a rank match. This improves the performance of various radix sort-related algorithms.
* Disabled padding in various cases where higher occupancy resulted in better performance despite more bank conflicts.
* The C++ version has changed from 14 to 17. C++14 will be deprecated in the next major release.
* You can use CMake HIP language support with CMake 3.18 and later. To use HIP language support, run `cmake` with `-DUSE_HIPCXX=ON` instead of setting the `CXX` variable to the path to a HIP-aware compiler.

#### Removed

* HIP-CPU support

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where `rmake.py` generated incorrect cmake commands in a Linux environment.
* Fixed an issue where `rocprim::partial_sort_copy` would yield a compile error if the input iterator was a const.

* Fixed a compilation issue when `rocprim::radix_key_codec<...>` is specialized with a 128-bit integer.
* Fixed the warp-level reduction `rocprim::warp_reduce.reduce` DPP implementation to avoid undefined intermediate values during the reduction.
* Fixed an issue that caused a segmentation fault when `hipStreamLegacy` was passed to certain API functions.

#### Upcoming changes

* Using the initialization constructor of `rocprim::reverse_iterator` will throw a deprecation warning. It will be marked as explicit in the next major release.

#### Resolved issues

* Ubuntu 24.04 compile failure with FFmpeg version 5.X and above has been fixed.

### **rocRAND** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* Extended tests to `rtest.py`. These tests are extra tests that did not fit the criteria of smoke and regression tests. They take much longer to run relative to smoke and regression tests. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run these tests.
* Added regression tests to `rtest.py`. These tests recreate scenarios that have caused hardware problems in past emulation environments. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run these tests.
* Added smoke test options, which run a subset of the unit tests and ensure that less than 2 GB of VRAM will be used. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* The `--emulation` option for `rtest.py`.

#### Changed

* `--test|-t` is no longer a required flag for `rtest.py`. Instead, the user can use either `--emulation|-e` or `--test|-t`, but not both.
* Removed the TBB dependency for multi-core processing of host-side generation.

### **ROCr Debug Agent** (2.0.4)

#### Added

* Functionality to print the associated kernel name for each wave.

### **ROCr Runtime** (1.15.0)

#### Added

* Support for asynchronous scratch reclaim on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Asynchronous scratch reclaim allows scratch memory that was assigned to Command Processor(cp) queues to be reclaimed back in case the application runs out of device memory or if the `hsa_amd_agent_set_async_scratch_limit` API is called with the threshold parameter as 0.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.28.0)

#### Added

* Application of a sequence of plane rotations to a given matrix for LASR
* Algorithm selection mechanism for hybrid computation
* Hybrid computation support for existing routines:
    - BDSQR
    - GESVD

#### Optimized

### **rocSPARSE** (3.4.0)

#### Added

* Added support for `rocsparse_matrix_type_triangular` in `rocsparse_spsv`.
* Added test filters `smoke`, `regression`, and `extended` for emulation tests.
* Added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute_ex` routines for iterative ILU.
* Added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve_ex` routines for iterative triangular solve.
* Added `GPU_TARGETS` to replace the now deprecated `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in CMake files.
* Added BSR format to the SpMM generic routine `rocsparse_spmm`.

#### Changed

* By default, the rocSPARSE shared library is built using the `--offload-compress` compiler option which compresses the fat binary. This significantly reduces the shared library binary size.

#### Optimized

* Improved the performance of `rocsparse_spmm` when used with row order for `B` and `C` dense matrices and the row split algorithm `rocsparse_spmm_alg_csr_row_split`.
* Improved the adaptive CSR sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithm when the sparse matrix has many empty rows at the beginning or at the end of the matrix. This improves the routines `rocsparse_spmv` and `rocsparse_spmv_ex` when the adaptive algorithm `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_adaptive` is used.
* Improved stream CSR sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithm when the sparse matrix size (number of rows) decreases. This improves the routines `rocsparse_spmv` and `rocsparse_spmv_ex` when the stream algorithm `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_stream` is used.
* Compared to `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute`, the routines `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute_ex` introduce several free iterations. A free iteration is an iteration that does not compute the evaluation of the stopping criteria, if enabled. This allows the user to tune the algorithm for performance improvements.
* Compared to `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve`, the routines `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve_ex` introduce several free iterations. A free iteration is an iteration that does not compute the evaluation of the stopping criteria. This allows the user to tune the algorithm for performance improvements.
* Improved the user documentation.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rocsparse_spgemm`, `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csrgemm`, and `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]bsrgemm` where incorrect results could be produced when rocSPARSE was built with optimization level `O0`. This was caused by a bug in the hash tables that could allow keys to be inserted twice.
* Fixed an issue in the routine `rocsparse_spgemm` when using `rocsparse_spgemm_stage_symbolic` and `rocsparse_spgemm_stage_numeric`, where the routine would crash when `alpha` and `beta` were passed as host pointers and where `beta != 0`.
* Fixed an issue in `rocsparse_bsrilu0`, where the algorithm was running out of bounds of the `bsr_val` array.

#### Upcoming changes

* Deprecated the `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute` routines. Users should use the newly added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute_ex` routines going forward.
* Deprecated the `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve` routines. Users should use the newly added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve_ex` routines going forward.
* Deprecated the use of `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in CMake files. Users should use `GPU_TARGETS` going forward.

### **ROCTracer** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* Tool deprecation message for ROCTracer.

### **rocThrust** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* Added a section to install Thread Building Block (TBB) inside `cmake/Dependencies.cmake` if TBB is not already available.
* Made TBB an optional dependency with the new `BUILD_HIPSTDPAR_TEST_WITH_TBB` flag. When the flag is `OFF` and TBB is not already on the machine, it will compile without TBB. Otherwise, it will compile with TBB.
* Added extended tests to `rtest.py`. These tests are extra tests that did not fit the criteria of smoke and regression tests. These tests will take much longer than smoke and regression tests. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run these tests.
* Added regression tests to `rtest.py`. These tests recreate scenarios that have caused hardware problems in past emulation environments. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run these tests.
* Added smoke test options, which run a subset of the unit tests and ensure that less than 2 GB of VRAM will be used. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* Added `--emulation` option for `rtest.py`
* Merged changes from upstream CCCL/thrust 2.4.0 and CCCL/thrust 2.5.0.
* Added `find_first_of`, `find_end`, `search`, and `search_n` to HIPSTDPAR.
* Updated HIPSTDPAR's `adjacent_find` to use the rocPRIM implementation.

#### Changed

* Changed the C++ version from 14 to 17. C++14 will be deprecated in the next major release.
* `--test|-t` is no longer a required flag for `rtest.py`. Instead, the user can use either `--emulation|-e` or `--test|-t`, but not both.
* Split HIPSTDPAR's forwarding header into several implementation headers.
* Fixed `copy_if` to work with large data types (512 bytes).

#### Known issues

*  `thrust::inclusive_scan_by_key` might produce incorrect results when it's used with -O2 or -O3 optimization.  This is caused by a recent compiler change and a fix will be made available at a later date.

### **rocWMMA** (1.7.0)

#### Added

* Added interleaved layouts that enhance the performance of GEMM operations.
* Emulation test suites. These suites are lightweight and well suited for execution on emulator platforms.

#### Changed

* Used `GPU_TARGETS` instead of `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in `cmakelists.txt`.
* Binary sizes can be reduced on supported compilers by using the `--offload-compress` compiler flag.

#### Resolved issues

* For a CMake bug workaround, set `CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH` when `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` is unset.

#### Upcoming changes
 
* rocWMMA will augment the fragment API objects with additional meta-properties that improve API expressiveness and configurability of parameters including multiple-wave cooperation. As part of this change, cooperative rocWMMA API functions `load_matrix_coop_sync` and `store_matrix_coop_sync` will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

## ROCm 6.3.3

See the [ROCm 6.3.3 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.3.3/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (0.1.2)

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an error that prevented GPU hardware activity from being presented in certain workloads.  

## ROCm 6.3.2

See the [ROCm 6.3.2 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.3.2/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **HIP** (6.3.2)

#### Added

* Tracking of Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) handlers:
    - Adds an atomic counter to track the outstanding HSA handlers.
    - Waits on CPU for the callbacks if the number exceeds the defined value.
* Codes to capture Architected Queueing Language (AQL) packets for HIP graph memory copy node between host and device. HIP enqueues AQL packets during graph launch.
* Control to use system pool implementation in runtime commands handling. By default, it is disabled.
* A new path to avoid `WaitAny` calls in `AsyncEventsLoop`. The new path is selected by default.
* Runtime control on decrement counter only if the event is popped. There is a new way to restore dead signals cleanup for the old path.
* A new logic in runtime to track the age of events from the kernel mode driver.

#### Optimized

* HSA callback performance. The HIP runtime creates and submits commands in the queue and interacts with HSA through a callback function. HIP waits for the CPU status from HSA to optimize the handling of events, profiling, commands, and HSA signals for higher performance.
* Runtime optimization which combines all logic of `WaitAny` in a single processing loop and avoids extra memory allocations or reference counting. The runtime won't spin on the CPU if all events are busy.
* Multi-threaded dispatches for performance improvement.
* Command submissions and processing between CPU and GPU by introducing a way to limit the software batch size.
* Switch to `std::shared_mutex` in book/keep logic in streams from multiple threads simultaneously, for performance improvement in specific customer applications.
* `std::shared_mutex` is used in memory object mapping, for performance improvement.

#### Resolved issues

* Race condition in multi-threaded producer/consumer scenario with `hipMallocFromPoolAsync`.
* Segmentation fault with `hipStreamLegacy` while using the API `hipStreamWaitEvent`.
* Usage of `hipStreamLegacy` in HIP event record.
* A soft hang in graph execution process from HIP user object. The fix handles the release of graph execution object properly considering synchronization on the device/stream. The user application now behaves the same with `hipUserObject` on both the AMD ROCm and NVIDIA CUDA platforms.

### **hipfort** (0.5.1)

#### Added

* Support for building with LLVM Flang.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed the exported `hipfort::hipsparse` CMake target.

### **AMD SMI** (24.7.1)

#### Changed

* `amd-smi monitor` displays `VCLOCK` and `DCLOCK` instead of `ENC_CLOCK` and `DEC_CLOCK`.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed `amd-smi monitor`'s reporting of encode and decode information. `VCLOCK` and `DCLOCK` are
  now associated with both `ENC_UTIL` and `DEC_UTIL`.

> [!NOTE]
> See the full [AMD SMI changelog](https://github.com/ROCm/amdsmi/blob/6.3.x/CHANGELOG.md) for more details and examples.

### **HIP** (6.3.1)

- Ability to retrieve a set of GPUs that are nearest to a given device at a specific link type level
  - Added `amdsmi_get_link_topology_nearest()` function to amd-smi C and Python Libraries.

- More supported utilization count types to `amdsmi_get_utilization_count()`

- `amd-smi set -L/--clk-limit ...` command. This is equivalent to rocm-smi's `--extremum` command which sets sclk's or mclk's soft minimum or soft maximum clock frequency.

- Unittest functionality to test `amdsmi` API calls in Python

- GPU memory overdrive percentage to `amd-smi metric -o`
  - Added `amdsmi_get_gpu_mem_overdrive_level()` function to AMD SMI C and Python Libraries.

- Ability to retrieve connection type and P2P capabilities between two GPUs
  - Added `amdsmi_topo_get_p2p_status()` function to amd-smi C and Python Libraries.
  - Added retrieving P2P link capabilities to CLI `amd-smi topology`.

- New `amdsmi_kfd_info_t` type and added information under `amd-smi list`

- Subsystem device ID to `amd-smi static --asic`. There are no underlying changes to `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info`.

- `Target_Graphics_Version` to `amd-smi static --asic` and `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info()`.

#### Changed

- Updated BDF commands to use KFD SYSFS for BDF: `amdsmi_get_gpu_device_bdf()`. This change aligns BDF output with ROCm SMI.

- Moved Python tests directory path install location.
  - `/opt/<rocm-path>/share/amd_smi/pytest/..` to `/opt/<rocm-path>/share/amd_smi/tests/python_unittest/..`
  - Removed PyTest dependency. Python testing now depends on the unittest framework only.

- Changed the `power` parameter in `amdsmi_get_energy_count()` to `energy_accumulator`.
  - Changes propagate forwards into the Python interface as well. Backwards compatibility is maintained.

- Updated Partition APIs and struct information and added `partition_id` to `amd-smi static --partition`.
  - As part of an overhaul to partition information, some partition information will be made available in the `amdsmi_accelerator_partition_profile_t`.
  - This struct will be filled out by a new API, `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile()`.
  - Future data from these APIs will eventually be added to `amd-smi partition`.

#### Removed

- `amd-smi reset --compute-partition` and `... --memory-partition` and associated APIs
  - This change is part of the partition redesign. Reset functionality will be reintroduced in a later update.
  - Associated APIs include `amdsmi_reset_gpu_compute_partition()` and `amdsmi_reset_gpu_memory_partition()`

- Usage of `_validate_positive` is removed in parser and replaced with `_positive_int` and `_not_negative_int` as appropriate.
  - This will allow `0` to be a valid input for several options in setting CPUs where appropriate (for example, as a mode or NBIOID).

#### Optimized

- Adjusted ordering of `gpu_metrics` calls to ensure that `pcie_bw` values remain stable in `amd-smi metric` & `amd-smi monitor`.
  - With this change additional padding was added to `PCIE_BW` `amd-smi monitor --pcie`

#### Known issues

- See [AMD SMI manual build issue](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.3.0/about/release-notes.html#amd-smi-manual-build-issue).

#### Resolved issues

- Improved Offline install process and lowered dependency for PyYAML.

- Fixed CPX not showing total number of logical GPUs.

- Fixed incorrect implementation of the Python API `amdsmi_get_gpu_metrics_header_info()`.

- `amdsmitst` `TestGpuMetricsRead` now prints metric in correct units.

#### Upcoming changes

- Python API for `amdsmi_get_energy_count()` will deprecate the `power` field in a future ROCm release and use `energy_accumulator` field instead.

- New memory and compute partition APIs will be added in a future ROCm release.
  - These APIs will be updated to fully populate the CLI and allowing compute (accelerator) partitions to be set by profile ID.
  - One API will be provided, to reset both memory and compute (accelerator).
  - The following APIs will remain:

    ```C
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_set_gpu_compute_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,
                                      amdsmi_compute_partition_type_t compute_partition);
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_get_gpu_compute_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,
                                      char *compute_partition, uint32_t len);
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_get_gpu_memory_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,

                                      char *memory_partition, uint32_t len);
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_set_gpu_memory_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,
                                      amdsmi_memory_partition_type_t memory_partition);
    ```

- `amd-smi set --compute-partition "SPX/DPX/CPX..."` will no longer be supported in a future ROCm release.
  - This is due to aligning with Host setups and providing more robust partition information through the APIs outlined above. Furthermore, new APIs which will be available on both BM/Host can set by profile ID.

- Added a preliminary `amd-smi partition` command.
  - The new partition command can display GPU information, including memory and accelerator partition information.
  - The command will be at full functionality once additional partition information from `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile()` has been implemented.

* Memory leak when the API `hipGraphAddMemAllocNode` is called.
* The `_sync()` version of crosslane builtins such as `shfl_sync()`,
  `__all_sync()` and `__any_sync()`, continue to be hidden behind the
  preprocessor macro `HIP_ENABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS`, and will be enabled
  unconditionally in the next ROCm release.

### **hipBLAS** (2.3.0)

#### Added

* Level 3 functions have an additional `ILP64` API for both C and Fortran (`_64` name suffix) with `int64_t` function arguments

#### Added

* Support for large indices in `hipcub::DeviceSegmentedReduce::*` has been added, with the exception
  of `DeviceSegmentedReduce::Arg*`. Although rocPRIM's backend provides support for all reduce
  variants, CUB does not support large indices in `DeviceSegmentedReduce::Arg*`. For this reason,
  large index support is not available for `hipcub::DeviceSegmentedReduce::Arg*`.

#### Changed

* Changed the default value of `rmake.py -a` to `default_gpus`. This is equivalent to `gfx906:xnack-,gfx1030,gfx1100,gfx1101,gfx1102`.
* The NVIDIA backend now requires CUB, Thrust, and libcu++ 2.3.2.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rmake.py` where the list storing cmake options would contain individual characters instead of a full string of options.
* Fixed an issue where `config.hpp` was not included in all hipCUB headers, resulting in build errors.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.17)

#### Changed

* The AMD backend is now compiled using amdclang++ instead of hipcc. The NVIDIA CUDA backend still uses hipcc-nvcc.
* CLI11 replaces Boost Program Options as the command line parser for clients.
* Building with the address sanitizer option sets xnack+ for the relevant GPU architectures.

### **hipfort** (0.5.0)

#### Added

* Added ROC-TX to the hipfort interfaces.

#### Changed

> [!NOTE]
> In ROCm 6.3.0, the hipRAND package version is incorrectly set to `2.11.0`.
> In ROCm 6.2.4, the hipRAND package version was `2.11.1`.
> The hipRAND version number will be corrected in a future ROCm release.

#### Changed

* Updated the default value for the `-a` argument from `rmake.py` to `gfx906:xnack-,gfx1030,gfx1100,gfx1101,gfx1102`.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rmake.py` where the list storing the CMake options would contain individual characters instead of a full string of options.

### **hipSOLVER** (2.3.0)

#### Added

    * `hipsolverDnXpotrf`
  * `potrs`
    * `hipsolverDnXpotrs`
  * `geqrf`
    * `hipsolverDnXgeqrf_bufferSize`
    * `hipsolverDnXgeqrf`

#### Changed

* Binaries in debug builds no longer have a `-d` suffix.
* Changed rocSPARSE and SuiteSparse to be runtime dependencies by default. The `BUILD_WITH_SPARSE` CMake option can still be used
  to convert them into build-time dependencies (now off by default).
* The `--no-sparse` option for the install script now only affects the hipSOLVER clients and their dependency on hipSPARSE. Use the
  `BUILD_HIPSPARSE_TESTS` CMake option to enable tests for the `hipsolverSp` API (on by default).

#### Upcoming changes

* The Fortran bindings provided in `hipsolver_module.f90` have been deprecated.
  The Fortran bindings provided by the hipfort project are recommended instead.

### **hipSPARSE** (3.1.2)

#### Added

* Added an alpha version of the `hipsparse-bench` executable to facilitate comparing NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE and rocSPARSE backends.

#### Changed

* Changed the default compiler from hipcc to amdclang in the install script and CMake files.
* Improved the user documentation.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed the gfortran dependency for the Azure Linux operating system.

#### Known issues

* In `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`, the external buffer is passed as a parameter. This does not match the NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE API. This extra external buffer parameter will be removed in a future release. For now, this extra parameter can be ignored and `nullptr` passed as it is unused internally by `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`.

### **hipSPARSELt** (0.2.2)

#### Added

* Support for a new data type combination: `INT8` inputs, `BF16` output, and `INT32` Matrix Core accumulation
* Support for row-major memory order (`HIPSPARSE_ORDER_ROW`)

#### Changed

* Changed the default compiler to amdclang++.

#### Upcoming changes

* `hipsparseLtDatatype_t` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of ROCm. `hipDataType` should be used instead.

### **hipTensor** (1.4.0)

#### Added

* Added support for tensor reduction, including APIs, CPU reference, unit tests, and documentation

#### Changed

* ASAN builds only support xnack+ targets.
* ASAN builds use `-mcmodel=large` to accommodate library sizes greater than 2GB.
* Updated the permute backend to accommodate changes to element-wise operations.
* Updated the actor-critic implementation.
* Various documentation formatting updates.

#### Optimized

* Split kernel instances to improve build times.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed a small memory leak by properly destroying HIP event objects in tests.
* Default strides calculations now follow column-major convention.

### **llvm-project** (18.0.0)

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where the compiler would incorrectly compile a program that used the `__shfl(var,
  srcLane, width)` function when one of the parameters to the function is undefined along some path

  distributed across multiple MPI ranks. These APIs can be enabled with the
  `ROCFFT_MPI_ENABLE` CMake option.  This option defaults to `OFF`.

  When `ROCFFT_MPI_ENABLE` is `ON`:

  * `rocfft_plan_description_set_comm` can be called to provide an
    MPI communicator to a plan description, which can then be passed
    to `rocfft_plan_create`.  Each rank calls

### **ROCm SMI** (7.4.0)

#### Added

- **Added `rsmi_dev_memory_partition_capabilities_get` which returns driver memory partition capablities.**  
Driver now has the ability to report what the user can set memory partition modes to. User can now see available
memory partition modes upon an invalid argument return from memory partition mode set (`rsmi_dev_memory_partition_set`).

- Support for GPU metrics 1.6 to `rsmi_dev_gpu_metrics_info_get()`. Updated
  `rsmi_dev_gpu_metrics_info_get()` and structure `rsmi_gpu_metrics_t` to include new fields for
  PVIOL / TVIOL, XCP (Graphics Compute Partitions) stats, and `pcie_lc_perf_other_end_recovery`.

- Ability to view raw GPU metrics using `rocm-smi --showmetrics`.

#### Changed

- Added back in C++ tests for `memorypartition_read_write`

- Updated `rsmi_dev_memory_partition_set` to not return until a successful restart of AMD GPU Driver.

- All APIs now have the ability to catch driver reporting invalid arguments.

#### Removals

- Removed `--resetcomputepartition`, and  `--resetmemorypartition` options and associated APIs.
  - This change is part of the partition feature redesign.
  - The related APIs `rsmi_dev_compute_partition_reset()` and `rsmi_dev_memory_partition_reset()`.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed `rsmi_dev_target_graphics_version_get`, `rocm-smi --showhw`, and `rocm-smi --showprod` not displaying properly for MI2x or Navi 3x ASICs.

#### Upcoming changes

- C++ tests for `memorypartition_read_write` are to be re-enabled in a future ROCm release.

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (0.1.0)

#### Changed

* Renamed to ROCm Systems Profiler from Omnitrace.
  * New package name: `rocprofiler-systems`
  * New repository: [https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-systems](https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-systems)
  * Reset the version to `0.1.0`
  * New binary prefix: `rocprof-sys-*`

- Babel parameters made runtime configurable.

#### Known issues

- See [ROCm Validation Suite needs specified configuration file](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4090).

### **rocPRIM** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* The `--test smoke` option has been added to `rtest.py`. When `rtest.py` is called with this option it runs a subset of tests such that the total test time is 5 minutes. Use `python3 ./rtest.py --test smoke` or `python3 ./rtest.py -t smoke` to run the smoke test.
* The `--seed` option has been added to `run_benchmarks.py`. The `--seed` option specifies a seed for the generation of random inputs. When the option is omitted, the default behavior is to use a random seed for each benchmark measurement.
* Added configuration autotuning to device partition (`rocprim::partition`, `rocprim::partition_two_way`, and `rocprim::partition_three_way`), to device select (`rocprim::select`, `rocprim::unique`, and `rocprim::unique_by_key`), and to device reduce by key (`rocprim::reduce_by_key`) to improve performance on selected architectures.
* Added `rocprim::uninitialized_array` to provide uninitialized storage in local memory for user-defined types.
* Added large segment support for `rocprim:segmented_reduce`.
* Added a parallel `nth_element` device function similar to `std::nth_element`. `nth_element` places elements that are smaller than the nth element before the nth element, and elements that are bigger than the nth element after the nth element.
* Added deterministic (bitwise reproducible) algorithm variants `rocprim::deterministic_inclusive_scan`, `rocprim::deterministic_exclusive_scan`, `rocprim::deterministic_inclusive_scan_by_key`, `rocprim::deterministic_exclusive_scan_by_key`, and `rocprim::deterministic_reduce_by_key`. These provide run-to-run stable results with non-associative operators such as float operations, at the cost of reduced performance.
* Added a parallel `partial_sort` and `partial_sort_copy` device functions similar to `std::partial_sort` and `std::partial_sort_copy`. `partial_sort` and `partial_sort_copy` arrange elements such that the elements are in the same order as a sorted list up to and including the middle index.

#### Changed

* Changed the default value of `rmake.py -a` to `default_gpus`. This is equivalent to `gfx906:xnack-,gfx1030,gfx1100,gfx1101,gfx1102`.
* Modified the input size in device adjacent difference benchmarks. Observed performance with these benchmarks might be different.
* Changed the default seed for `device_benchmark_segmented_reduce`.

#### Removed

* `rocprim::thread_load()` and `rocprim::thread_store()` have been deprecated. Use `dereference()` instead.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rmake.py` where the list storing cmake options would contain individual characters instead of a full string of options.
* Resolved an issue in `rtest.py` where it crashed if the `build` folder was created without `release` or `debug` subdirectories.
* Resolved an issue with `rtest.py` on Windows where passing an absolute path to `--install_dir` caused a `FileNotFound` error.
* rocPRIM functions are no longer forcefully inlined on Windows. This significantly reduces the build time of debug builds.
* `block_load`, `block_store`, `block_shuffle`, `block_exchange`, and `warp_exchange` now use placement `new` instead of copy assignment (`operator=`) when writing to local memory. This fixes the behavior of custom types with non-trivial copy assignments.
* Fixed a bug in the generation of input data for benchmarks, which caused incorrect performance to be reported in specific cases. It may affect the reported performance for one-byte types (`uint8_t` and `int8_t`) and instantiations of `custom_type`. Specifically, device binary search, device histogram, device merge and warp sort are affected.
* Fixed a bug for `rocprim::merge_path_search` where using `unsigned` offsets would produce incorrect results.
* Fixed a bug for `rocprim::thread_load` and `rocprim::thread_store` where `float` and `double` were not cast to the correct type, resulting in incorrect results.
* Resolved an issue where tests were failing when they were compiled with `-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS=ON`.
* Resolved an issue where algorithms that used an internal serial merge routine caused a memory access fault that resulted in potential performance drops when using block sort, device merge sort (block merge), device merge, device partial sort, and device sort (merge sort).
* Fixed memory leaks in unit tests due to missing calls to `hipFree()` and the incorrect use of hipGraphs.
* Fixed an issue where certain inputs to `block_sort_merge()`, `device_merge_sort_merge_path()`, `device_merge()`, and `warp_sort_stable()` caused an assertion error during the call to `serial_merge()`.

* Fixed `rocsparse_Xgemmi` failures when the y grid dimension is too large. This occurred when `n >= 65536`.
* Fixed the gfortran dependency for the Azure Linux operating system.

### **rocThrust** (3.2.0)

#### Added

* Merged changes from upstream CCCL/thrust 2.3.2
  * Only the NVIDIA backend uses `tuple` and `pair` types from libcu++, other backends continue to use the original Thrust implementations and hence do not require libcu++ (CCCL) as a dependency.
* Added the `thrust::hip::par_det` execution policy to enable bitwise reproducibility on algorithms that are not bitwise reproducible by default.

#### Changed

  - Handling to detect VMs with passthrough configurations in CLI tool.
  - Process Isolation and Clear SRAM functionality to the CLI tool for VMs.
  - Added Ring Hang event.
- Added macros that were in `amdsmi.h` to the AMD SMI Python library `amdsmi_interface.py`.
- Renamed `amdsmi_set_gpu_clear_sram_data()` to `amdsmi_clean_gpu_local_data()`.

#### Removed

- Removed `throttle-status` from `amd-smi monitor` as it is no longer reliably supported.
- Removed elevated permission requirements for `amdsmi_get_gpu_process_list()`.

#### Optimized

- Updated CLI error strings to specify invalid device type queried.
- Multiple structure updates in `amdsmi.h` and `amdsmi_interface.py` to align with host/guest.
  - Added `amdsmi.h` and `amdsmi_interface.py`.
  - `amdsmi_clk_info_t` struct
  - Added `AMDSMI` prefix to multiple structures.
- Updated `dpm_policy` references to `soc_pstate`.
- Updated `amdsmi_get_gpu_board_info()` product_name to fallback to `pciids` file.
- Updated `amdsmi_get_gpu_board_info()` now has larger structure sizes for `amdsmi_board_info_t`.
- Updated CLI voltage curve command output.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed multiple processes not being registered in `amd-smi process` with JSON and CSV format.
- `amdsmi_get_gpu_board_info()` no longer returns junk character strings.
- Fixed parsing of `pp_od_clk_voltage` within `amdsmi_get_gpu_od_volt_info`.
- Fixed Leftover Mutex deadlock when running multiple instances of the CLI tool. When running
  `amd-smi reset --gpureset --gpu all` and then running an instance of `amd-smi static` (or any
  other subcommand that access the GPUs) a mutex would lock and not return requiring either a
  clear of the mutex in `/dev/shm` or rebooting the machine.

#### Known issues

- `amdsmi_get_gpu_process_isolation` and `amdsmi_clean_gpu_local_data` commands do not work.
  They will be supported in a future release.

### **Composable Kernel** (1.1.0)

#### Changed

- Added support for:
  - Permute scale for any dimension (#1198).
  - Combined elementwise op (#1217).
  - Multi D in grouped convolution backward weight (#1280).
  - K or C equal to 1 for `fp16` in grouped convolution backward weight (#1280).
  - Large batch in grouped convolution forward (#1332).
- Added `CK_TILE` layernorm example (#1339).
- `CK_TILE`-based Flash Attention 2 kernel is now merged into the upstream repository as ROCm backend.

#### Optimized

- Support universal GEMM in grouped convolution forward (#1320).
- Optimizations for low M and N in grouped convolution backward weight (#1303).
- Added a functional enhancement and compiler bug fix for FlashAttention Forward Kernel.
- `FP8` GEMM performance optimization and tuning (#1384).
- Added FlashAttention backward pass performance optimization (#1397).

### **HIP** (6.2.0)

#### Changed

- Added the `_sync()` version of crosslane builtins such as `shfl_sync()`, `__all_sync()` and `__any_sync()`. These take
  a 64-bit integer as an explicit mask argument.
  - In HIP 6.2, these are hidden behind the preprocessor macro `HIP_ENABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS`, and will be enabled
    unconditionally in a future HIP release.

- Added new HIP APIs:
  - `hipGetProcAddress` returns the pointer to driver function, corresponding to the defined driver function symbol.
  - `hipGetFuncBySymbol` returns the pointer to device entry function that matches entry function `symbolPtr`.
  - `hipStreamBeginCaptureToGraph` begins graph capture on a stream to an existing graph.
  - `hipGraphInstantiateWithParams` creates an executable graph from a graph.

- Added a new flag `integrated` -- supported in device property.

  - The integrated flag is added in the struct `hipDeviceProp_t`. On the integrated APU system, the runtime driver
    detects and sets this flag to `1`, in which case the API `hipDeviceGetAttribute` returns enum `hipDeviceAttribute_t` for
    `hipDeviceAttributeIntegrated` as value 1, for integrated GPU device.

- Added initial support for 8-bit floating point datatype in `amd_hip_fp8.h`. These are accessible via `#include <hip/hip_fp8.h>`.

- Added UUID support for environment variable `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed stream capture support in HIP graphs. Prohibited and unhandled operations are fixed during stream capture in the HIP runtime.
- Fixed undefined symbol error for `hipTexRefGetArray` and `hipTexRefGetBorderColor`.

#### Upcoming changes

- The `_sync()` version of crosslane builtins such as `shfl_sync()`, `__all_sync()`, and `__any_sync()` will be enabled unconditionally in a future HIP release.

### **hipBLAS** (2.2.0)

#### Changed

* Added a new ILP64 API for level 2 functions for both C and FORTRAN (`_64` name suffix) with `int64_t` function arguments.
* Added a new ILP64 API for level 1 `_ex` functions.

* The `install.sh` script now invokes the `rmake.py` script. Made other various improvements to the build scripts.
* Changed library dependencies in the `install.sh` script from `rocblas` and `rocsolver` to the development packages
  `rocblas-dev` and `rocsolver-dev`.
* Updated Linux AOCL dependency to release 4.2 `gcc` build.
* Updated Windows `vcpkg` dependencies to release 2024.02.14.

### **hipBLASLt** (0.8.0)

#### Changed

* Added extension APIs:
  *`hipblasltExtAMaxWithScale`.
  * `GemmTuning` extension parameter to set `wgm` by user.
* Added support for:
  * `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_AMAX_D_POINTER` for `FP8`/`BF8` datatype.
  * `FP8`/`BF8` input, `FP32/FP16/BF16/F8/BF8` output (gfx94x platform only).
  * `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_COMPUTE_INPUT_TYPE_A_EXT` and `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_COMPUTE_INPUT_TYPE_B_EXT` for `FP16` input data type to use `FP8`/`BF8` MFMA.
* Added support for gfx110x.

#### Optimized

* Improved library loading time.

### **HIPCC** (1.1.1)

#### Changed

* Split `hipcc` package into two packages for different hardware platforms.

* Cleaned up references to environment variables.

* Enabled `hipcc` and `hipconfig` binaries (`hipcc.bin`, `hipconfig.bin`) by
  default, instead of their Perl counterparts.

* Enabled function calls.

* Added support for generating packages for ROCm stack targeting static libraries.

#### Resolved issues

* Implemented numerous bug fixes and quality improvements.

### **hipCUB** (3.2.0)

#### Changed

* Added `DeviceCopy` function for parity with CUB.
* Added `enum WarpExchangeAlgorithm` to the rocPRIM backend, which is used as
  the new optional template argument for `WarpExchange`.
  * The potential values for the enum are `WARP_EXCHANGE_SMEM` and
    `WARP_EXCHANGE_SHUFFLE`.
  * `WARP_EXCHANGE_SMEM` stands for the previous algorithm, while
    `WARP_EXCHANGE_SHUFFLE` performs the exchange via shuffle operations.
  * `WARP_EXCHANGE_SHUFFLE` does not require any pre-allocated shared memory,
    but the `ItemsPerThread` must be a divisor of `WarpSize`.
* Added `tuple.hpp` which defines templates `hipcub::tuple`,
  `hipcub::tuple_element`, `hipcub::tuple_element_t` and `hipcub::tuple_size`.
* Added new overloaded member functions to `BlockRadixSort` and
  `DeviceRadixSort` that expose a `decomposer` argument. Keys of a custom type
  (`key_type`) can be sorted via these overloads, if an appropriate decomposer
  is passed. The decomposer has to implement `operator(const key_type&)` which
  returns a `hipcub::tuple` of references pointing to members of `key_type`.

* On AMD GPUs (using the HIP backend), you can now issue hipCUB API calls inside of
  HIP graphs, with several exceptions:
   * `CachingDeviceAllocator`
   * `GridBarrierLifetime`
   * `DeviceSegmentedRadixSort`
   * `DeviceRunLengthEncode`
  Currently, these classes rely on one or more synchronous calls to function correctly. Because of this, they cannot be used inside of HIP graphs.

#### Removed

* Deprecated `debug_synchronous` in hipCUB-2.13.2, and it no longer has any effect. With this release, passing `debug_synchronous`
  to the device functions results in a deprecation warning both at runtime and at compile time.
  * The synchronization that was previously achievable by passing `debug_synchronous=true` can now be achieved at compile time
    by setting the `CUB_DEBUG_SYNC` (or higher debug level) or the `HIPCUB_DEBUG_SYNC` preprocessor definition.
  * The compile time deprecation warnings can be disabled by defining the `HIPCUB_IGNORE_DEPRECATED_API` preprocessor definition.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed the derivation for the accumulator type for device scan algorithms in the rocPRIM backend being different compared to CUB.
  It now derives the accumulator type as the result of the binary operator.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.15)

#### Resolved issues

* Added `hip::host` as a public link library, as `hipfft.h` includes HIP runtime headers.
* Prevented C++ exceptions leaking from public API functions.
* Made output of `hipfftXt` match `cufftXt` in geometry and alignment for 2D and 3D FFTs.

### **HIPIFY** (18.0.0)

#### Changed

- Added support for:
  - NVIDIA CUDA 12.4.1
  - cuDNN 9.1.1
  - LLVM 18.1.6
- Added full hipBLASLt support.

#### Resolved issues

- HIPIFY now applies `reinterpret_cast` for an explicit conversion between pointer-to-function and pointer-to-object;
  affected functions: `hipFuncGetAttributes`, `hipFuncSetAttribute`, `hipFuncSetCacheConfig`, `hipFuncSetSharedMemConfig`, `hipLaunchKernel`, and `hipLaunchCooperativeKernel`.

### **hipRAND** (2.11.0)

#### Changed

* Added support for setting generator output ordering in C and C++ API.
* `hiprandCreateGeneratorHost` dispatches to the host generator in the rocRAND backend instead of returning with
  `uHIPRAND_STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.
* Added options to create:
  * A host generator to the Fortran wrapper.
  * A host generator to the Python wrapper.
* Previously, for internal testing with HMM the environment variable `ROCRAND_USE_HMM` was used in previous
  versions. The environment variable is now named `HIPRAND_USE_HMM`.
* Static library -- moved all internal symbols to namespaces to avoid potential symbol name collisions when linking.
* Device API documentation is improved in this version.

#### Removed

* Removed the option to build hipRAND as a submodule to rocRAND.
* Removed references to, and workarounds for, the deprecated `hcc`.
* Removed support for finding rocRAND based on the environment variable `ROCRAND_DIR`.
  Use `ROCRAND_PATH` instead.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed a build error when using Clang++ directly due to unsupported references to `amdgpu-target`.

### **hipSOLVER** (2.2.0)

#### Changed

- Added compatibility-only functions:
  - `auxiliary`
    - `hipsolverDnCreateParams`, `hipsolverDnDestroyParams`, `hipsolverDnSetAdvOptions`
  - `getrf`
    - `hipsolverDnXgetrf_bufferSize`
    - `hipsolverDnXgetrf`
  - `getrs`
    - `hipsolverDnXgetrs`
- Added support for building on Ubuntu 24.04 and CBL-Mariner.
- Added `hip::host` to `roc::hipsolver` usage requirements.
- Added functions
  - `syevdx`/`heevdx`
    - `hipsolverSsyevdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverDsyevdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverCheevdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverZheevdx_bufferSize`
    - `hipsolverSsyevdx`, `hipsolverDsyevdx`, `hipsolverCheevdx`, `hipsolverZheevdx`
  - `sygvdx`/`hegvdx`
    - `hipsolverSsygvdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverDsygvdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverChegvdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverZhegvdx_bufferSize`
    - `hipsolverSsygvdx`, `hipsolverDsygvdx`, `hipsolverChegvdx`, `hipsolverZhegvdx`

- Updated `csrlsvchol` to perform numerical factorization on the GPU. The symbolic factorization is still performed on the CPU.
- Renamed `hipsolver-compat.h` to `hipsolver-dense.h`.

#### Removed

- Removed dependency on `cblas` from the hipSOLVER test and benchmark clients.

### **hipSPARSE** (3.1.1)

#### Changed

* Added the missing `hipsparseCscGet()` routine.

* All internal hipSPARSE functions now exist inside a namespace.
* Match deprecations found in cuSPARSE 12.x.x when using cuSPARSE backend.
* Improved the user manual and contribution guidelines.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed `SpGEMM` and `SpGEMM_reuse` routines that were not matching cuSPARSE behavior.

#### Known issues

* In `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`, the external buffer is currently passed as a parameter. This does not match the cuSPARSE API
  and this extra external buffer parameter will be removed in a future release. For now this extra parameter can be
  ignored and passed a `nullptr` as it is unused internally by `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`.

### **hipSPARSELt** (0.2.1)

#### Optimized

* Refined test cases.

### **hipTensor** (1.3.0)

#### Changed

* Added support for:
  * Tensor permutation of ranks of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
  * Tensor contraction of M6N6K6: M, N, K up to rank 6
* Added tests for:
  * Tensor permutation of ranks of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
  * Tensor contraction of M6N6K6: M, N, K up to rank 6
  * YAML parsing to support sequential parameters ordering.
* Prefer `amd-llvm-devel` package before system LLVM library.
* Preferred compilers changed to `CC=amdclang` `CXX=amdclang++`.
* Updated actor-critic selection for new contraction kernel additions.
* Updated installation, programmer's guide, and API reference documentation.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed LLVM parsing crash.
* Fixed memory consumption issue in complex kernels.
* Workaround implemented for compiler crash during debug build.
* Allow random modes ordering for tensor contractions.

### **llvm-project** (18.0.0)

#### Changed

* LLVM IR

  * The `llvm.stacksave` and `llvm.stackrestore` intrinsics now use an overloaded pointer type to support non-0 address
    spaces.

  * Added `llvm.exp10` intrinsic.

* LLVM infrastructure

  * The minimum Clang version to build LLVM in C++20 configuration is now `clang-17.0.6`.

* TableGen

  * Added constructs for debugging TableGen files:

    * `dump` keyword to dump messages to standard error. See [#68793](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/68793).

    * `!repr` bang operator to inspect the content of values. See [#68716](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/68716).

* AArch64 backend

  * Added support for Cortex-A520, Cortex-A720 and Cortex-X4 CPUs.

* AMDGPU backend

  * `llvm.sqrt.f32` is now lowered correctly. Use `llvm.amdgcn.sqrt.f32` for raw instruction access.

  * Implemented `llvm.stacksave` and `llvm.stackrestore` intrinsics.

  * Implemented `llvm.get.rounding`.

* ARM backend

  * Added support for Cortex-M52 CPUs.

  * Added execute-only support for Armv6-M.

* RISC-V backend

  * The `Zfa` extension version was upgraded to 1.0 and is no longer experimental.

  * `Zihintntl` extension version was upgraded to 1.0 and is no longer experimental.

  * Intrinsics were added for `Zk*`, `Zbb`, and `Zbc`. See
    [Scalar Bit Manipulation Extension Intrinsics](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-c-api-doc/blob/main/src/c-api.adoc#scalar-bit-manipulation-extension-intrinsics) in the RISC-V C API specification.

  * Default ABI with F but without D was changed to ilp32f for RV32 and to lp64f for RV64.

  * The `Zvbb`, `Zvbc`, `Zvkb`, `Zvkg`, `Zvkn`, `Zvknc`, `Zvkned`, `Zvkng`, `Zvknha`, `Zvknhb`, `Zvks`, `Zvksc`,
    `Zvksed`, `Zvksg`, `Zvksh`, and `Zvkt` extension version was upgraded to 1.0 and is no longer experimental. However,
    the C intrinsics for these extensions are still experimental. To use the C intrinsics for these extensions,
    `-menable-experimental-extensions` needs to be passed to Clang.

  * `-mcpu=sifive-p450` was added.

  * CodeGen of `RV32E` and `RV64E` is supported experimentally.

  * CodeGen of `ilp32e` and `lp64e` is supported experimentally.

* X86 backend

  * Added support for the RDMSRLIST and WRMSRLIST instructions.

  * Added support for the WRMSRNS instruction.

  * Support ISA of AMX-FP16 which contains `tdpfp16ps` instruction.

  * Support ISA of CMPCCXADD.

  * Support ISA of AVX-IFMA.

  * Support ISA of AVX-VNNI-INT8.

  * Support ISA of AVX-NE-CONVERT.

  * `-mcpu=raptorlake`, `-mcpu=meteorlake` and `-mcpu=emeraldrapids` are now supported.

  * `-mcpu=sierraforest`, `-mcpu=graniterapids` and `-mcpu=grandridge` are now supported.

  * `__builtin_unpredictable` (unpredictable metadata in LLVM IR), is handled by X86 Backend. X86CmovConversion pass now
    respects this builtin and does not convert CMOVs to branches.

  * Add support for the PBNDKB instruction.

  * Support ISA of SHA512.

  * Support ISA of SM3.

  * Support ISA of SM4.

  * Support ISA of AVX-VNNI-INT16.

  * `-mcpu=graniterapids-d` is now supported.

  * The `i128` type now matches GCC and clang’s `__int128` type. This mainly benefits external projects such as Rust
    which aim to be binary compatible with C, but also fixes code generation where LLVM already assumed that the type
    matched and called into `libgcc` helper functions.

  * Support ISA of USER_MSR.

  * Support ISA of AVX10.1-256 and AVX10.1-512.

  * `-mcpu=pantherlake` and `-mcpu=clearwaterforest` are now supported.

  * `-mapxf` is supported.

  * Marking global variables with `code_model = "small"/"large"` in the IR now overrides the global code model to allow
    32-bit relocations or require 64-bit relocations to the global variable.

  * The medium code model’s code generation was audited to be more similar to the small code model where possible.

* C API

  * Added `LLVMGetTailCallKind` and `LLVMSetTailCallKind` to allow getting and setting `tail`, `musttail`, and `notail` attributes on call instructions.

  * Added `LLVMCreateTargetMachineWithOptions`, along with helper functions for an opaque option structure, as an
    alternative to `LLVMCreateTargetMachine`. The option structure exposes an additional setting (that is, the target
    ABI) and provides default values for unspecified settings.

  * Added `LLVMGetNNeg` and `LLVMSetNNeg` for getting and setting the new `nneg` flag on zext instructions, and
    `LLVMGetIsDisjoint` and `LLVMSetIsDisjoint` for getting and setting the new disjoint flag on or instructions.

  * Added the following functions for manipulating operand bundles, as well as building call and invoke instructions
    that use operand bundles:

    * `LLVMBuildCallWithOperandBundles`

    * `LLVMBuildInvokeWithOperandBundles`

    * `LLVMCreateOperandBundle`

    * `LLVMDisposeOperandBundle`

    * `LLVMGetNumOperandBundles`

    * `LLVMGetOperandBundleAtIndex`

    * `LLVMGetNumOperandBundleArgs`

    * `LLVMGetOperandBundleArgAtIndex`

    * `LLVMGetOperandBundleTag`

  * Added `LLVMGetFastMathFlags` and `LLVMSetFastMathFlags` for getting and setting the fast-math flags of an
    instruction, as well as `LLVMCanValueUseFastMathFlags` for checking if an instruction can use such flag.

* CodeGen infrastructure

  * A new debug type `isel-dump` is added to show only the SelectionDAG dumps after each ISel phase (i.e.
    `-debug-only=isel-dump`). This new debug type can be filtered by function names using
    `-filter-print-funcs=<function names>`, the same flag used to filter IR dumps after each Pass. Note that the
    existing `-debug-only=isel` will take precedence over the new behavior and print SelectionDAG dumps of every single
    function regardless of `-filter-print-funcs`’s values.

* Metadata info

  * Added a new loop metadata `!{!”llvm.loop.align”, i32 64}`.

* LLVM tools

  * `llvm-symbolizer` now treats invalid input as an address for which source information is not found.

  * `llvm-readelf` now supports `--extra-sym-info` (-X) to display extra information (section name) when showing
    symbols.

  * `llvm-readobj --elf-output-style=JSON` no longer prefixes each JSON object with the file name. Previously, each
    object file’s output looked like `"main.o":{"FileSummary":{"File":"main.o"},...}` but is now
    `{"FileSummary":{"File":"main.o"},...}`. This allows each JSON object to be parsed in the same way, since each
    object no longer has a unique key. Tools that consume `llvm-readobj`’s JSON output should update their parsers
    accordingly.

  * `llvm-objdump` now uses `--print-imm-hex` by default, which brings its default behavior closer in line with `objdump`.

  * `llvm-nm` now supports the `--line-numbers` (`-l`) option to use debugging information to print symbols’ filenames and line numbers.

  * `llvm-symbolizer` and `llvm-addr2line` now support addresses specified as symbol names.

  * `llvm-objcopy` now supports `--gap-fill` and `--pad-to` options, for ELF input and binary output files only.

* LLDB

  * `SBType::FindDirectNestedType` function is added. It’s useful for formatters to quickly find directly nested type
    when it’s known where to search for it, avoiding more expensive global search via `SBTarget::FindFirstType`.

  * Renamed `lldb-vscode` to `lldb-dap` and updated its installation instructions to reflect this. The underlying
    functionality remains unchanged.

  * The `mte_ctrl` register can now be read from AArch64 Linux core files.

  * LLDB on AArch64 Linux now supports debugging the Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) and Scalable Matrix Extension 2
    (SME2) for both live processes and core files. For details refer to the AArch64 Linux documentation.

  * LLDB now supports symbol and binary acquisition automatically using the DEBUFINFOD protocol. The standard mechanism
    of specifying DEBUFINOD servers in the DEBUGINFOD_URLS environment variable is used by default. In addition, users
    can specify servers to request symbols from using the LLDB setting `plugin.symbol-locator.debuginfod.server_urls`,
    override or adding to the environment variable.

  * When running on AArch64 Linux, `lldb-server` now provides register field information for the following registers:
    `cpsr`, `fpcr`, `fpsr`, `svcr` and `mte_ctrl`.

* Sanitizers

  * HWASan now defaults to detecting use-after-scope bugs.

#### Removals

* LLVM IR

  * The constant expression variants of the following instructions have been removed:

    * `and`

    * `or`

    * `lshr`

    * `ashr`

    * `zext`

    * `sext`

    * `fptrunc`

    * `fpext`

    * `fptoui`

    * `fptosi`

    * `uitofp`

    * `sitofp`

* RISC-V backend

  * XSfcie extension and SiFive CSRs and instructions that were associated with it have been removed. None of these CSRs and
    instructions were part of “SiFive Custom Instruction Extension”. The LLVM project needs to work with
    SiFive to define and document real extension names for individual CSRs and instructions.

* Python bindings

  * The Python bindings have been removed.

* C API

  * The following functions for creating constant expressions have been removed, because the underlying constant
    expressions are no longer supported. Instead, an instruction should be created using the `LLVMBuildXYZ` APIs, which
    will constant fold the operands if possible and create an instruction otherwise:

    * `LLVMConstAnd`

    * `LLVMConstOr`

    * `LLVMConstLShr`

    * `LLVMConstAShr`

    * `LLVMConstZExt`

    * `LLVMConstSExt`

    * `LLVMConstZExtOrBitCast`

    * `LLVMConstSExtOrBitCast`

    * `LLVMConstIntCast`

    * `LLVMConstFPTrunc`

    * `LLVMConstFPExt`

    * `LLVMConstFPToUI`

    * `LLVMConstFPToSI`

    * `LLVMConstUIToFP`

    * `LLVMConstSIToFP`

    * `LLVMConstFPCast`

* CodeGen infrastructure

  * `PrologEpilogInserter` no longer supports register scavenging during forwards frame index elimination. Targets
    should use backwards frame index elimination instead.

  * `RegScavenger` no longer supports forwards register scavenging. Clients should use backwards register scavenging
    instead, which is preferred because it does not depend on accurate kill flags.

* LLDB

  * `SBWatchpoint::GetHardwareIndex` is deprecated and now returns `-1` to indicate the index is unavailable.

  * Methods in `SBHostOS` related to threads have had their implementations removed. These methods will return a value
    indicating failure.

#### Resolved issues

* AArch64 backend

  * Neoverse-N2 was incorrectly marked as an Armv8.5a core. This has been changed to an Armv9.0a core. However, crypto
    options are not enabled by default for Armv9 cores, so `-mcpu=neoverse-n2+crypto` is now required to enable crypto for
    this core. As far as the compiler is concerned, Armv9.0a has the same features enabled as Armv8.5a, with the
    exception of crypto.

* Windows target

  * The LLVM filesystem class `UniqueID` and function `equivalent`() no longer determine that distinct different path
    names for the same hard linked file actually are equal. This is an intentional tradeoff in a bug fix, where the bug
    used to cause distinct files to be considered equivalent on some file systems. This change fixed the GitHub issues
    [#61401](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/61401) and [#22079](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/22079).

#### Known issues

The compiler may incorrectly compile a program that uses the
``__shfl(var, srcLane, width)`` function when one of the parameters to
the function is undefined along some path to the function. For most functions,
uninitialized inputs cause undefined behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> The ``-Wall`` compilation flag prompts the compiler to generate a warning if a variable is uninitialized along some path.

As a workaround, initialize the parameters to ``__shfl``. For example:

```{code-block} cpp
unsigned long istring = 0 // Initialize the input to __shfl
return __shfl(istring, 0, 64)
```

### **Omniperf** (2.0.1)

#### Known issues

- Error when running Omniperf with an application with command line arguments. As a workaround, create an
  intermediary script to call the application with the necessary arguments, then call the script with Omniperf. This
  issue is fixed in a future release of Omniperf. See [#347](https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-compute/issues/347).

- Omniperf might not work with AMD Instinct MI300 GPUs out of the box, resulting in the following error:
  "*ERROR gfx942 is not enabled rocprofv1. Available profilers include: ['rocprofv2']*". As a workaround, add the
  environment variable `export ROCPROF=rocprofv2`.

- Omniperf's Python dependencies may not be installed with your ROCm installation, resulting in the following message:

  "*[ERROR] The 'dash>=1.12.0' package was not found in the current execution environment.*

  *[ERROR] The 'dash-bootstrap-components' package was not found in the current execution environment.*

  *Please verify all of the Python dependencies called out in the requirements file are installed locally prior to running omniperf.*

  *See: /opt/rocm-6.2.0/libexec/omniperf/requirements.txt*"

  As a workaround, install these Python requirements manually: `pip install /opt/rocm-6.2.0/libexec/omniperf/requirements.txt`.

  * GEMM self-check and accuracy-check support for checking consistency and accuracy of GEMM output.

  * Trignometric float and random integer matrix data initialization support.

* Updated GST performance benchmark test for better numbers.

### **rocPRIM** (3.2.0)

#### Changed

* Added new overloads for `warp_scan::exclusive_scan` that take no initial value. These new overloads will write an unspecified result to the first value of each warp.
* The internal accumulator type of `inclusive_scan(_by_key)` and `exclusive_scan(_by_key)` is now exposed as an optional type parameter.
  * The default accumulator type is still the value type of the input iterator (inclusive scan) or the initial value's type (exclusive scan).
    This is the same behaviour as before this change.
* Added a new overload for `device_adjacent_difference_inplace` that allows separate input and output iterators, but allows them to point to the same element.
* Added new public APIs for deriving resulting type on device-only functions:
  * `rocprim::invoke_result`
  * `rocprim::invoke_result_t`
  * `rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op`
  * `rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op_t`
* Added the new `rocprim::batch_copy` function. Similar to `rocprim::batch_memcpy`, but copies by element, not with memcpy.
* Added more test cases, to better cover supported data types.
* Added an optional `decomposer` argument for all member functions of `rocprim::block_radix_sort` and all functions of `device_radix_sort`.
  To sort keys of an user-defined type, a decomposer functor should be passed. The decomposer should produce a `rocprim::tuple`
  of references to arithmetic types from the key.
* Added `rocprim::predicate_iterator` which acts as a proxy for an underlying iterator based on a predicate.
  It iterates over proxies that holds the references to the underlying values, but only allow reading and writing if the predicate is `true`.
  It can be instantiated with:
  * `rocprim::make_predicate_iterator`
  * `rocprim::make_mask_iterator`
* Added custom radix sizes as the last parameter for `block_radix_sort`. The default value is 4, it can be a number between 0 and 32.
* Added `rocprim::radix_key_codec`, which allows the encoding/decoding of keys for radix-based sorts. For user-defined key types, a decomposer functor should be passed.
* Updated some tests to work with supported data types.

#### Removed

* Deprecated the internal header `detail/match_result_type.hpp`.
* Deprecated `TwiddleIn` and `TwiddleOut` in favor of `radix_key_codec`.
* Deprecated the internal `::rocprim::detail::radix_key_codec` in favor of a new public utility with the same name.

#### Optimized

* Improved the performance of `warp_sort_shuffle` and `block_sort_bitonic`.
* Created an optimized version of the `warp_exchange` functions `blocked_to_striped_shuffle` and `striped_to_blocked_shuffle` when the warpsize is equal to the items per thread.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed incorrect results of `warp_exchange::blocked_to_striped_shuffle` and `warp_exchange::striped_to_blocked_shuffle` when the block size is
  larger than the logical warp size. The test suite has been updated with such cases.
* Fixed incorrect results returned when calling device `unique_by_key` with overlapping `values_input` and `values_output`.
* Fixed incorrect output type used in `device_adjacent_difference`.
* Fixed an issue causing incorrect results on the GFX10 (RDNA1, RDNA2) ISA and GFX11 ISA on device scan algorithms `rocprim::inclusive_scan(_by_key)` and `rocprim::exclusive_scan(_by_key)` with large input types.
* Fixed an issue with `device_adjacent_difference`. It now considers both the
  input and the output type for selecting the appropriate kernel launch config.
  Previously only the input type was considered, which could result in compilation errors due to excessive shared memory usage.
* Fixed incorrect data being loaded with `rocprim::thread_load` when compiling with `-O0`.
* Fixed a compilation failure in the host compiler when instantiating various block and device algorithms with block sizes not divisible by 64.

### **ROCProfiler** (2.0.0)

#### Removed

- Removed `pcsampler` sample code due to deprecation from version 2.

### **rocRAND** (3.1.0)

#### Changed

* Added `rocrand_create_generator_host`.
  * The following generators are supported:
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_MRG31K3P`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_MRG32K3A`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_PHILOX4_32_10`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_THREEFRY2_32_20`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_THREEFRY2_64_20`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_THREEFRY4_32_20`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_THREEFRY4_64_20`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_XORWOW`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_QUASI_SCRAMBLED_SOBOL32`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_QUASI_SCRAMBLED_SOBOL64`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_QUASI_SOBOL32`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_QUASI_SOBOL64`
  * The host-side generators support multi-core processing. On Linux, this requires the TBB (Thread Building Blocks) development package to be installed on the system when building rocRAND (`libtbb-dev` on Ubuntu and derivatives).
    * If TBB is not found when configuring rocRAND, the configuration is still successful, and the host generators are executed on a single CPU thread.
* Added the option to create a host generator to the Python wrapper.
* Added the option to create a host generator to the Fortran wrapper
* Added dynamic ordering. This ordering is free to rearrange the produced numbers,
  which can be specific to devices and distributions. It is implemented for:
  * XORWOW, MRG32K3A, MTGP32, Philox 4x32-10, MRG31K3P, LFSR113, and ThreeFry
* Added support for using Clang as the host compiler for alternative platform compilation.
* C++ wrapper:
  * Added support for `lfsr113_engine` being constructed with a seed of type `unsigned long long`, not only `uint4`.
  * Added optional order parameter to the constructor of `mt19937_engine`.
* Added the following functions for the `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_MTGP32` generator:
  * `rocrand_normal2`
  * `rocrand_normal_double2`
  * `rocrand_log_normal2`
  * `rocrand_log_normal_double2`
* Added `rocrand_create_generator_host_blocking` which dispatches without stream semantics.
* Added host-side generator for `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_MTGP32`.
* Added offset and skipahead functionality to LFSR113 generator.
* Added dynamic ordering for architecture `gfx1102`.

* For device-side generators, you can now wrap calls to `rocrand_generate_*` inside of a hipGraph. There are a few
  things to be aware of:
  - Generator creation (`rocrand_create_generator`), initialization (`rocrand_initialize_generator`), and destruction (`rocrand_destroy_generator`) must still happen outside the hipGraph.
  - After the generator is created, you may call API functions to set its seed, offset, and order.
  - After the generator is initialized (but before stream capture or manual graph creation begins), use `rocrand_set_stream` to set the stream the generator will use within the graph.
  - A generator's seed, offset, and stream may not be changed from within the hipGraph. Attempting to do so may result in unpredictable behaviour.
  - API calls for the poisson distribution (for example, `rocrand_generate_poisson`) are not yet supported inside of hipGraphs.
  - For sample usage, see the unit tests in `test/test_rocrand_hipgraphs.cpp`
* Building rocRAND now requires a C++17 capable compiler, as the internal library sources now require it. However consuming rocRAND is still possible from C++11 as public headers don't make use of the new features.
* Building rocRAND should be faster on machines with multiple CPU cores as the library has been
  split to multiple compilation units.
* C++ wrapper: the `min()` and `max()` member functions of the generators and distributions are now `static constexpr`.
* Renamed and unified the existing `ROCRAND_DETAIL_.*_BM_NOT_IN_STATE` to `ROCRAND_DETAIL_BM_NOT_IN_STATE`
* Static and dynamic library: moved all internal symbols to namespaces to avoid potential symbol name collisions when linking.

#### Removed

* Deprecated the following typedefs. Please use the unified `state_type` alias instead.
  * `rocrand_device::threefry2x32_20_engine::threefry2x32_20_state`
  * `rocrand_device::threefry2x64_20_engine::threefry2x64_20_state`
  * `rocrand_device::threefry4x32_20_engine::threefry4x32_20_state`
  * `rocrand_device::threefry4x64_20_engine::threefry4x64_20_state`
* Deprecated the following internal headers:
  * `src/rng/distribution/distributions.hpp`.
  * `src/rng/device_engines.hpp`.
* Removed references to and workarounds for deprecated hcc.
* Removed support for HIP-CPU.

#### Known issues

- `SOBOL64` and `SCRAMBLED_SOBOL64` generate poisson-distributed `unsigned long long int` numbers instead of `unsigned int`. This will be fixed in a future release.

- Added partial generalized symmetric/hermitian-definite eigenvalue decomposition using Divide & Conquer and Bisection:
  - SYGVDX (with `batched` and `strided_batched` versions)
  - HEGVDX (with `batched` and `strided_batched` versions)
- Renamed install script arguments of the form `*_dir to *-path`. Arguments of the form `*_dir` remain functional for
  backwards compatibility.
- Functions working with arrays of size n - 1 can now accept null pointers when n = 1.

#### Optimized

* Updated `adjecent_difference` to make use of `rocprim:adjecent_difference` when iterators are comparable and not equal otherwise use `rocprim:adjacent_difference_inplace`.

#### Known issues

* `thrust::reduce_by_key` outputs are not bit-wise reproducible, as run-to-run results for pseudo-associative reduction operators (e.g. floating-point arithmetic operators) are not deterministic on the same device.
* Note that currently, rocThrust memory allocation is performed in such a way that most algorithmic API functions cannot be called from within hipGraphs.

### **rocWMMA** (1.5.0)

#### Changed

* Added internal utilities for:
  * Element-wise vector transforms.
  * Cross-lane vector transforms.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [detailed ROCm SMI changelog](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib/blob/docs/6.1.1/CHANGELOG.md) with code samples for more information.

## ROCm 6.1.0

See the [ROCm 6.1.0 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.1.0/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (24.4.1)

#### Added

* New monitor command for GPU metrics.
  Use the monitor command to customize, capture, collect, and observe GPU metrics on
  target devices.

* Integration with E-SMI.
  The EPYC™ System Management Interface In-band Library is a Linux C-library that provides in-band
  user space software APIs to monitor and control your CPU’s power, energy, performance, and other
  system management functionality. This integration enables access to CPU metrics and telemetry
  through the AMD SMI API and CLI tools.

### **Composable Kernel** (1.1.0)

#### Added

* New architecture support.
  CK now supports to the following architectures to enable efficient image denoising on the following
  AMD GPUs: gfx1030, gfx1100, gfx1031, gfx1101, gfx1032, gfx1102, gfx1034, gfx1103, gfx1035,
  gfx1036

#### Changed

* FP8 rounding logic is replaced with stochastic rounding.
  Stochastic rounding mimics a more realistic data behavior and improves model convergence.

### **HIP** (6.1)

#### Added

* New environment variable to enable kernel run serialization.
  The default `HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING` value is `0` (disable); which causes kernels to run as defined in
  the queue. When set to `1` (enable), the HIP runtime serializes the kernel queue, which behaves the
  same as `AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL`.

### **hipBLASLt** (0.7.0)

#### Added

* New GemmTuning extension parameter. GemmTuning allows you to set a split-k value for each solution, which is more feasible for
  performance tuning.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.14)

#### Added

* New multi-GPU support for single-process transforms. Multiple GPUs can be used to perform a transform in a single process. Note that this initial
  implementation is a functional preview.

### **HIPIFY** (17.0.0)

#### Changed

* Skipped code blocks: Code blocks that are skipped by the preprocessor are no longer hipified under the
  `--default-preprocessor` option. To hipify everything, despite conditional preprocessor directives
  (`#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#elif`, or `#else`), don't use the `--default-preprocessor` or `--amap` options.

### **hipSPARSELt** (0.1.0)

#### Added

* Structured sparsity matrix support extensions.
  Structured sparsity matrices help speed up deep-learning workloads. We now support `B` as the
  sparse matrix and `A` as the dense matrix in Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SPMM). Prior to this
  release, we only supported sparse (matrix A) x dense (matrix B) matrix multiplication. Structured
  sparsity matrices help speed up deep learning workloads.

### **hipTensor** (1.2.0)

#### Added

* 4D tensor permutation and contraction support.
  You can now perform tensor permutation on 4D tensors and 4D contractions for F16, BF16, and
  Complex F32/F64 datatypes.

### **llvm-project** (17.0.0)

#### Changed

* Combined projects. ROCm Device-Libs, ROCm Compiler Support, and hipCC are now located in
  the `llvm-project/amd` subdirectory of AMD's fork of the LLVM project. Previously, these projects
  were maintained in separate repositories. Note that the projects themselves will continue to be
  packaged separately.

* Split the `rocm-llvm` package. This package has been split into a required and an optional package: 

  * **rocm-llvm(required)**: A package containing the essential binaries needed for compilation.

  * **rocm-llvm-dev(optional)**: A package containing binaries for compiler and application developers.

### **MIGraphX** (2.9.0)

#### Added

* Improved performance for transformer-based models.
  We added support for FlashAttention, which benefits models like BERT, GPT, and Stable Diffusion.

* New Torch-MIGraphX driver.
  This driver calls MIGraphX directly from PyTorch. It provides an `mgx_module` object that you can
  invoke like any other Torch module, but which utilizes the MIGraphX inference engine internally.
  Torch-MIGraphX supports FP32, FP16, and INT8 datatypes.

* FP8 support. We now offer functional support for inference in the FP8E4M3FNUZ datatype. You
  can load an ONNX model in FP8E4M3FNUZ using C++ or Python APIs, or `migraphx-driver`.
  You can quantize a floating point model to FP8 format by using the `--fp8` flag with `migraphx-driver`.
  To accelerate inference, MIGraphX uses hardware acceleration on MI300 for FP8 by leveraging FP8
  support in various backend kernel libraries.

### **MIOpen** (3.1.0)

#### Added

* Improved performance for inference and convolutions.
  Inference support now provided for Find 2.0 fusion plans. Additionally, we've enhanced the Number of
  samples, Height, Width, and Channels (NHWC) convolution kernels for heuristics. NHWC stores data
  in a format where the height and width dimensions come first, followed by channels.

### **OpenMP** (17.60.0)

#### Added

* New MI300 FP atomics. Application performance can now improve by leveraging fast floating-point atomics on MI300 (gfx942).

#### Changed

* Implicit Zero-copy is triggered automatically in XNACK-enabled MI300A systems.
  Implicit Zero-copy behavior in `non unified_shared_memory` programs is triggered automatically in
  XNACK-enabled MI300A systems (for example, when using the `HSA_XNACK=1` environment
  variable). OpenMP supports the 'requires `unified_shared_memory`' directive to support programs
  that don’t want to copy data explicitly between the CPU and GPU. However, this requires that you add
  these directives to every translation unit of the program.

### **RCCL** (2.18.6)

#### Changed

* NCCL 2.18.6 compatibility.
  RCCL is now compatible with NCCL 2.18.6, which includes increasing the maximum IB network interfaces to 32 and fixing network device ordering when creating communicators with only one GPU
  per node.

* Doubled simultaneous communication channels.
  We improved MI300X performance by increasing the maximum number of simultaneous
  communication channels from 32 to 64.

### **rocALUTION** (3.1.1)

#### Added

* New multiple node and GPU support.
  Unsmoothed and smoothed aggregations and Ruge-Stueben AMG now work with multiple nodes
  and GPUs. For more information, refer to the 
  [API documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocALUTION/en/docs-6.1.0/usermanual/solvers.html#unsmoothed-aggregation-amg).

### **rocDecode** (0.5.0)

#### Added

* New ROCm component.
  rocDecode ROCm's newest component, providing high-performance video decode support for AMD
  GPUs. To learn more, refer to the 
  [documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocDecode/en/latest/).

### **ROCm Data Center Tool** (0.3.0)

#### Changed

* C++ upgrades.
  RDC was upgraded from C++11 to C++17 to enable a more modern C++ standard when writing RDC plugins.

### **RPP** (1.5.0)

#### Added

* New backend support.
  Audio processing support added for the `HOST` backend and 3D Voxel kernels support
  for the `HOST` and `HIP` backends.

### **ROCm Validation Suite** (1.0)

#### Added

* New datatype support.
  Added BF16 and FP8 datatypes based on General Matrix Multiply(GEMM) operations in the GPU Stress Test (GST) module. This provides additional performance benchmarking and stress testing based on the newly supported datatypes.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.25.0)

#### Added

* New EigenSolver routine.
  Based on the Jacobi algorithm, a new EigenSolver routine was added to the library. This routine computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix with improved performance.

### **ROCTracer** (4.1)

#### Changed

* New versioning and callback enhancements.
  Improved to match versioning changes in HIP Runtime and supports runtime API callbacks and activity record logging. The APIs of different runtimes at different levels are considered different API domains with assigned domain IDs.

## ROCm 6.0.2

See the [ROCm 6.0.2 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.0.2/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.13)

#### Changed

* Removed the Git submodule for shared files between rocFFT and hipFFT; instead, just copy the files
 over (this should help simplify downstream builds and packaging)

## ROCm 6.0.0

See the [ROCm 6.0.0 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.0.0/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (23.4.2)

#### Added

* Integrated the E-SMI (EPYC-SMI) library.
  You can now query CPU-related information directly through AMD SMI. Metrics include power,
  energy, performance, and other system details.

* Added support for gfx942 metrics.
  You can now query MI300 device metrics to get real-time information. Metrics include power,
  temperature, energy, and performance.

### **HIP** (6.0.0)

#### Added

* New features to improve resource interoperability.
  * For external resource interoperability, we've added new structs and enums.
  * We've added new members to HIP struct `hipDeviceProp_t` for surfaces, textures, and device
    identifiers.

#### Changed

* Changes impacting backward compatibility.
  There are several changes impacting backward compatibility: we changed some struct members and
  some enum values, and removed some deprecated flags. For additional information, please refer to
  the Changelog.

### **hipCUB** (3.0.0)

#### Changed

* Additional CUB API support.
  The hipCUB backend is updated to CUB and Thrust 2.1.

### **HIPIFY** (17.0.0)

#### Added

* Hipified rocSPARSE.
  We've implemented support for the direct hipification of additional cuSPARSE APIs into rocSPARSE
  APIs under the `--roc` option. This covers a major milestone in the roadmap towards complete
  cuSPARSE-to-rocSPARSE hipification.

#### Optimized

* Enhanced CUDA2HIP document generation.
  API versions are now listed in the CUDA2HIP documentation. To see if the application binary
  interface (ABI) has changed, refer to the
  [*C* column](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIPIFY/en/latest/tables/CUDA_Runtime_API_functions_supported_by_HIP.html)
  in our API documentation.

### **hipRAND** (2.10.16)

* Official release.
  hipRAND is now a *standalone project*--it's no longer available as a submodule for rocRAND.

### **hipTensor** (1.1.0)

#### Added

* Added architecture support.
  We've added contraction support for gfx942 architectures, and f32 and f64 data
  types.

#### Optimized

* Upgraded testing infrastructure.
  hipTensor will now support dynamic parameter configuration with input YAML config.

### **llvm-project** (17.0.0)

#### Added

* Added kernel argument optimization on gfx942.
  With the new feature, you can preload kernel arguments into Scalar General-Purpose Registers
  (SGPRs) rather than pass them in memory. This feature is enabled with a compiler option, which also
  controls the number of arguments to pass in SGPRs. For more information, see:
  [https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#preloaded-kernel-arguments](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#preloaded-kernel-arguments)

#### Optimized

* Improved register allocation at -O0.
  We've improved the register allocator used at -O0 to avoid compiler crashes (when the signature is
  'ran out of registers during register allocation').

* Improved generation of debug information.
  We've improved compile time when generating debug information for certain corner cases. We've
  also improved the compiler to eliminate compiler crashes when generating debug information.

### **MIGraphX** (2.8.0)

#### Added

* Added TorchMIGraphX.
  We introduced a Dynamo backend for Torch, which allows PyTorch to use MIGraphX directly
  without first requiring a model to be converted to the ONNX model format. With a single line of
  code, PyTorch users can utilize the performance and quantization benefits provided by MIGraphX.

* Added INT8 support across the MIGraphX portfolio.
  We now support the INT8 data type. MIGraphX can perform the quantization or ingest
  prequantized models. INT8 support extends to the MIGraphX execution provider for ONNX Runtime.

* Boosted overall performance with rocMLIR.
  We've integrated the rocMLIR library for ROCm-supported RDNA and CDNA GPUs. This
  technology provides MLIR-based convolution and GEMM kernel generation.

### **ROCgdb** (13.2)

#### Added

* Added support for additional GPU architectures.
  * Navi 3 Series: gfx1100, gfx1101, and gfx1102.
  * MI300 Series: gfx942.

### **ROCm SMI** (6.0.0)

#### Added

* Improved accessibility to GPU partition nodes.
  You can now view, set, and reset the compute and memory partitions. You'll also get notifications of
  a GPU busy state, which helps you avoid partition set or reset failure.

#### Optimized

* Upgraded GPU metrics version 1.4.
  The upgraded GPU metrics binary has an improved metric version format with a content version
  appended to it. You can read each metric within the binary without the full `rsmi_gpu_metric_t` data
  structure.

* Updated GPU index sorting.
  We made GPU index sorting consistent with other ROCm software tools by optimizing it to use
  `Bus:Device.Function` (BDF) instead of the card number.

### **ROCm Validation Suite** (1.0)

#### Added

* Added GPU and operating system support.
  We added support for MI300X GPU in GPU Stress Test (GST).

### **ROCProfiler** (2.0)

#### Added

* Added option to specify desired ROCProfiler version.
  You can now use rocProfV1 or rocProfV2 by specifying your desired version, as the legacy rocProf
  (`rocprofv1`) provides the option to use the latest version (`rocprofv2`).

* Added ATT support for parallel kernels.
  The automatic ISA dumping process also helps ATT successfully parse multiple kernels running in
  parallel, and provide cycle-accurate occupancy information for multiple kernels at the same time.

#### Changed

* Automated the ISA dumping process by Advance Thread Tracer.
  Advance Thread Tracer (ATT) no longer depends on user-supplied Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
  and compilation process (using ``hipcc --save-temps``) to dump ISA from the running kernels.

### **ROCr Runtime** (1.12.0)

#### Added

* Support for SDMA link aggregation.
  If multiple XGMI links are available when making SDMA copies between GPUs, the copy is
  distributed over multiple links to increase peak bandwidth.

### **rocThrust** (3.0.0)

#### Added

* Added Thrust 2.1 API support.
  rocThrust backend is updated to Thrust and CUB 2.1.

### **rocWMMA** (1.3.0)

#### Added

* **Added new architecture support**.
    We added support for gfx942 architectures.

* **Added data type support**.
    We added support for f8, bf8, xf32 data types on supporting architectures, and for bf16 in the HIP RTC
    environment.

* **Added support for the PyTorch kernel plugin**.
    We added awareness of `__HIP_NO_HALF_CONVERSIONS__` to support PyTorch users.

### **TransferBench** (beta)

#### Optimized

* Improved ordering control.
  You can now set the thread block size (`BLOCK_SIZE`) and the thread block order (`BLOCK_ORDER`)
  in which thread blocks from different transfers are run when using a single stream.

* Added comprehensive reports.
  We modified individual transfers to report X Compute Clusters (XCC) ID when `SHOW_ITERATIONS`
  is set to 1.

* Improved accuracy in result validation.
  You can now validate results for each iteration instead of just once for all iterations.

### **ROCprofiler**

In ROCm 5.6 the `rocprofilerv1` and `rocprofilerv2` include and library files of
ROCm 5.5 are split into separate files. The `rocmtools` files that were
deprecated in ROCm 5.5 have been removed.

  | ROCm 5.6        | rocprofilerv1                       | rocprofilerv2                          |
  |-----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
  | **Tool script** | `bin/rocprof`                       | `bin/rocprofv2`                        |
  | **API include** | `include/rocprofiler/rocprofiler.h` | `include/rocprofiler/v2/rocprofiler.h` |
  | **API library** | `lib/librocprofiler.so.1`           | `lib/librocprofiler.so.2`              |

The ROCm Profiler Tool that uses `rocprofilerV1` can be invoked using the
following command:

```sh
$ rocprof …
```

To write a custom tool based on the `rocprofilerV1` API do the following:

```C
main.c:
#include <rocprofiler/rocprofiler.h> // Use the rocprofilerV1 API
int main() {
  // Use the rocprofilerV1 API
  return 0;
}
```

This can be built in the following manner:

```sh
$ gcc main.c -I/opt/rocm-5.6.0/include -L/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib -lrocprofiler64
```

The resulting `a.out` will depend on
`/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib/librocprofiler64.so.1`.

The ROCm Profiler that uses `rocprofilerV2` API can be invoked using the
following command:

```sh
$ rocprofv2 …
```

To write a custom tool based on the `rocprofilerV2` API do the following:

```C
main.c:
#include <rocprofiler/v2/rocprofiler.h> // Use the rocprofilerV2 API
int main() {
  // Use the rocprofilerV2 API
  return 0;
}
```

This can be built in the following manner:

```sh
$ gcc main.c -I/opt/rocm-5.6.0/include -L/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib -lrocprofiler64-v2
```

The resulting `a.out` will depend on

#### Added

- CMake functionality to improve build parallelism of the test suite that splits compilation units by
function or by parameters.
- New overload for `BlockAdjacentDifference::SubtractLeftPartialTile` that takes a predecessor item.

#### Changed

- Improved build parallelism of the test suite by splitting up large compilation units for `DeviceRadixSort`,

### **hipSOLVER** (1.6.0)

#### Added

- Added compatibility-only functions
  - gesvdaStridedBatched
    - hipsolverDnSgesvdaStridedBatched_bufferSize, hipsolverDnDgesvdaStridedBatched_bufferSize, hipsolverDnCgesvdaStridedBatched_bufferSize, hipsolverDnZgesvdaStridedBatched_bufferSize
    - hipsolverDnSgesvdaStridedBatched, hipsolverDnDgesvdaStridedBatched, hipsolverDnCgesvdaStridedBatched, hipsolverDnZgesvdaStridedBatched

#### Added

- client smoke test dataset added for quick validation using command rocblas-test --yaml rocblas_smoke.yaml
- Added stream order device memory allocation as a non-default beta option.

#### Changed

- Level 2, Level 1, and Extension functions: argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values.  With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer.   This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour.
- Add variable to turn on/off ieee16/ieee32 tests for mixed precision gemm
- Allow hipBLAS to select int8 datatype

- Created a rocfft_kernel_cache.db file next to the installed library. SBCC kernels are moved to this file when built with the library, and are runtime-compiled for new GPU architectures.
- Added gfx1100 and gfx1102 to default AMDGPU_TARGETS.

#### Changed

- Moved runtime compilation cache to in-memory by default.  A default on-disk cache can encounter contention problems 
on multi-node clusters with a shared filesystem.  rocFFT can still be told to use an on-disk cache by setting the 
ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH environment variable.

#### Optimized

- Optimized some strided large 1D plans.

### **rocPRIM** (2.12.0)

#### Changed

- `device_partition`, `device_unique`, and `device_reduce_by_key` now support problem 
  sizes larger than 2^32 items.

#### Removed

  implementation is missing. To avoid further confusion the documentation is removed until a decision is made on
  implementing the function.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed the compilation failure in `device_merge` if the two key iterators don&#39;t match.

### **rocRAND** (2.10.16)

- LFSR113 pseudorandom number generator based on L&#39;Ecuyer, 1999, &#34;Tables of maximally equidistributed combined LFSR generators&#34;.
- SCRAMBLED_SOBOL32 and SCRAMBLED_SOBOL64 quasirandom number generators. The Scrambled Sobol sequences are generated by scrambling the output of a Sobol sequence.

#### Changed

- The `mrg_&lt;distribution&gt;_distribution` structures, which provided numbers based on MRG32K3A, are now replaced by `mrg_engine_&lt;distribution&gt;_distribution`, where `&lt;distribution&gt;` is `log_normal`, `normal`, `poisson`, or `uniform`. These structures provide numbers for MRG31K3P (with template type `rocrand_state_mrg31k3p`) and MRG32K3A (with template type `rocrand_state_mrg32k3a`).

#### Resolved issues

- Sobol64 now returns 64 bits random numbers, instead of 32 bits random numbers. As a result, the performance of this generator has regressed.
- Fixed a bug that prevented compiling code in C++ mode (with a host compiler) when it included the rocRAND headers on Windows.

### **hipSPARSE** (2.3.1)

#### Added

- Add SpMM and SpMM batched for CSC format

### **rocALUTION** (2.1.0)

#### Added

- Benchmarking tool
- Ext+I Interpolation with sparsify strategies added for RS-AMG

#### Optimized

- ParallelManager

### **rocBLAS** (2.45.0)

#### Added

- install.sh option --upgrade_tensile_venv_pip to upgrade Pip in Tensile Virtual Environment. The corresponding CMake option is TENSILE_VENV_UPGRADE_PIP.
- install.sh option --relocatable or -r adds rpath and removes ldconf entry on rocBLAS build.
- install.sh option --lazy-library-loading to enable on-demand loading of tensile library files at runtime to speedup rocBLAS initialization.
- Support for RHEL9 and CS9.
- Added Numerical checking routine for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrices, so that they could be checked for any numerical abnormalities such as NaN, Zero, infinity and denormal value.

#### Changed

- Unifying library logic file names: affects HBH (-&gt;HHS_BH), BBH (-&gt;BBS_BH), 4xi8BH (-&gt;4xi8II_BH). All HPA types are using the new naming convention now.
- Level 3 function argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values. With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer. This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour.
- Level 1, 2, and 3 function argument checking for enums is now more rigorously matching legacy BLAS so returns rocblas_status_invalid_value if arguments do not match the accepted subset.
- Add quick-return for internal trmm and gemm template functions.
- Moved function block sizes to a shared header file.
- Level 1, 2, and 3 functions use rocblas_stride datatype for offset.
- Modified the matrix and vector memory allocation in our test infrastructure for all Level 1, 2, 3 and BLAS_EX functions.
- Added specific initialization for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrix types in our test infrastructure.
- Added NaN tests to the test infrastructure for the rest of Level 3, BLAS_EX functions.

#### Removed

- install.sh options  --hip-clang , --no-hip-clang, --merge-files, --no-merge-files are removed.
- is_complex helper is now deprecated.  Use rocblas_is_complex instead.
- The enum truncate_t and the value truncate is now deprecated and will removed from the ROCm release 6.0. It is replaced by rocblas_truncate_t and rocblas_truncate, respectively. The new enum rocblas_truncate_t and the value rocblas_truncate could be used from this ROCm release for an easy transition.

  indepent of how many values are generated per call.
  - Only in the case of XORWOW, MRG32K3A, PHILOX4X32_10, SOBOL32 and SOBOL64
  - This only holds true if the size in each call is a divisor of the distributions
    `output_width` due to performance

### **rocFFT** (1.0.13)

#### Added

- Added new kernel generator for select fused-2D transforms.

#### Optimized

- Improved many plans by removing unnecessary transpose steps.
- Optimized scheme selection for 3D problems.
  - Imposed less restrictions on 3D_BLOCK_RC selection. More problems can use 3D_BLOCK_RC and
    have some performance gain.
  - Enabled 3D_RC. Some 3D problems with SBCC-supported z-dim can use less kernels and get benefit.
  - Force --length 336 336 56 (dp) use faster 3D_RC to avoid it from being skipped by conservative
    threshold test.
- Optimized some even-length R2C/C2R cases by doing more operations
  in-place and combining pre/post processing into Stockham kernels.
- Added radix-17.

#### Resolved issues

- Improved large 1D transform decompositions.

### **rocPRIM** (2.10.12)

#### Added

- Added scan size limit feature
- Added reduce size limit feature
- Added transform size limit feature
- Add block_load_striped and block_store_striped
- Add gather_to_blocked to gather values from other threads into a blocked arrangement
- The block sizes for device merge sorts initial block sort and its merge steps are now separate in its kernel config
    - the block sort step supports multiple items per thread

#### Changed

- size_limit for scan, reduce and transform can now be set in the config struct instead of a parameter
- Device_scan and device_segmented_scan: `inclusive_scan` now uses the input-type as accumulator-type, `exclusive_scan` uses initial-value-type.
  - This particularly changes behaviour of small-size input types with large-size output types (e.g. `short` input, `int` output).
  - And low-res input with high-res output (e.g. `float` input, `double` output)
- Revert old Fiji workaround, because they solved the issue at compiler side
- Update README cmake minimum version number
- Block sort support multiple items per thread
    - currently only powers of two block sizes, and items per threads are supported and only for full blocks
- Bumped the minimum required version of CMake to 3.16

#### Resolved issues

- Enable bfloat16 tests and reduce threshold for bfloat16
- Fix device scan limit_size feature
- Non-optimized builds no longer trigger local memory limit errors

#### Known issues

- Unit tests may soft hang on MI200 when running in hipMallocManaged mode.
- device_segmented_radix_sort, device_scan unit tests failing for HIP on Windows
- ReduceEmptyInput cause random faulire with bfloat16

### **rocSOLVER** (3.16.0)

#### Added

- Symmetric matrix factorizations:
    - LASYF
    - SYTF2, SYTRF (with batched and strided\_batched versions)
- Added `rocsolver_get_version_string_size` to help with version string queries
- Added `rocblas_layer_mode_ex` and the ability to print kernel calls in the trace and profile logs
- Expanded batched and strided\_batched sample programs.

#### Changed

- The rocsolver-test client now prints the rocSOLVER version used to run the tests,
  rather than the version used to build them
- The rocsolver-bench client now prints the rocSOLVER version used in the benchmark

#### Optimized

- Improved general performance of LU factorization
- Increased parallelism of specialized kernels when compiling from source, reducing build times on multi-core systems.

#### Resolved issues

- Added missing `stdint.h` include to `rocsolver.h`

### **rocSPARSE** (2.0.0)

#### Added

- csrmv, coomv, ellmv, hybmv for (conjugate) transposed matrices
- csrmv for symmetric matrices

#### Changed

- spmm\_ex is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release
- Optimization for gtsv

### **rocThrust** (2.13.0)

#### Added

- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.13.0
- Updated to match upstream Thrust 1.14.0
- Added async scan

#### Changed

- Scan algorithms: `inclusive_scan` now uses the input-type as accumulator-type, `exclusive_scan` uses initial-value-type.
    - This particularly changes behaviour of small-size input types with large-size output types (e.g. `short` input, `int` output).
    - And low-res input with high-res output (e.g. `float` input, `double` output)

### **Tensile** (4.31.0)

#### Added

- DirectToLds support (x2/x4)
- DirectToVgpr support for DGEMM
- Parameter to control number of files kernels are merged into to better parallelize kernel compilation
