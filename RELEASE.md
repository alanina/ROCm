documentation to verify compatibility and system requirements.
```

## Release highlights

The following are notable new features and improvements in ROCm 6.4.0. For changes to individual components, see
[Detailed component changes](#detailed-component-changes).

### New kernel support added in Megatron-LM framework for ROCm

The Megatron-LM framework for ROCm is a specialized fork of the robust Megatron-LM, designed to enable efficient training of large-scale language models on AMD GPUs. The Megatron-LM fork adds support to the following fused kernels:

* Fused Attention (Fused QKV)
* Fused Layer Norm
* Fused ROPE

See [Training a model with Megatron-LM for ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/rocm-for-ai/training/benchmark-docker/megatron-lm.html) for more information.

### CPX mode with NPS4 memory mode supported

On AMD Instinct™ MI300X systems, you can now use Core Partitioned X-celerator (CPX) mode in combination with the Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) Per Socket (NPS4) memory mode. This partition mode configuration can be applied to a Single Root IO Virtualization (SR-IOV) host or a bare metal environment. This feature enables better performance with small language models (13B parameters or less) that can fit within one CPX GPU.

To learn how to switch to CPX and NPS4 modes, see [Change GPU partition
modes](https://instinct.docs.amd.com/projects/amdgpu-docs/en/latest/system-optimization/mi300x.html#change-gpu-partition-modes)
in the Instinct documentation.

To learn how CPX and NPS4 partition modes can benefit RCCL performance on MI300X systems, see [RCCL usage tips](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rccl/en/latest/how-to/rccl-usage-tips.html#rccl-performance-with-cpx-and-nps4).

### Kernel-mode GPU Driver (KMD) and user space software compatibility improved

ROCm 6.4.0 has been tested to allow you to choose a combination of AMD Kernel-mode GPU Driver (KMD) and ROCm user space software from ROCm releases up to a year apart (assuming hardware support is available in both). This compatibility has been tested for backward direction in ROCm 6.4.0, and it will be tested in forward directions for every new driver release occurring for a year from ROCm 6.4.0 release (for example, older user space with newer KMD and vice versa).

### Separation of user space and driver space components documentation

As of ROCm 6.4.0, the driver space components documentation has moved from [AMD ROCm documentation](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/) to its own documentation site, [AMD Instinct Data Center GPU Driver](https://instinct.docs.amd.com/latest/). The goal is to make the software for AMD Instinct GPUs more modular. This helps in having a clear understanding of the options for installation combinations of Instinct driver and multiple supported ROCm user space versions.

Information about the variant of the `amdgpu` driver built for Instinct GPUs is available on [AMD Instinct Data Center GPU Driver](https://instinct.docs.amd.com/projects/amdgpu-docs/en/latest/). See [ROCm/ROCK-Kernel-Driver](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCK-Kernel-Driver) GitHub repository for source code, which is planned to be renamed to **instinct-driver** in a future ROCm release. For ROCm 6.4.0, the versioning scheme for the Instinct driver is parallel to the ROCm versioning; that is, 6.4.0. In future ROCm releases, the Instinct driver version is planned to be separate from the ROCm versioning.

Separating the major software components improves the upgrade experience by:
* Allowing you to upgrade your Instinct driver independently of ROCm user space, or vice versa.
* Having bug fixes released independently in either the Instinct driver or ROCm user space.

### PyTorch 2.6 and 2.5 support added

ROCm 6.4.0 adds support for PyTorch 2.6 and 2.5. See the [Compatibility
matrix](../../docs/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.rst)
for the complete list of PyTorch versions tested for compatibility with ROCm. See [Installing deep learning frameworks for ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/deep-learning-rocm.html) for more information about supported deep learning frameworks.  

### VP9 support added to rocDecode and rocPyDecode

VP9 support is added to [rocDecode](https://github.com/ROCm/rocDecode) and [rocPyDecode](https://github.com/ROCm/rocPyDecode), allowing enhanced codec support with VP9 encoding.

### Bitstream reader support added to rocDecode

The new bitstream reader feature has been added to [rocDecode](https://github.com/ROCm/rocDecode). It contains built-in stream file parsers, including an elementary stream file parser and an IVF container file parser. It enables decoding without the requirement for FFmpeg demuxer. The reader can parse AVC, HEVC, and AV1 elementary stream files, and AV1 IVF container files. See [Using the rocDecode bitstream reader APIs](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocDecode/en/latest/how-to/using-rocDecode-bitstream.html) for more information.

### DLPack support added to rocAL

[rocAL](https://github.com/ROCm/rocAL) now supports DLPack, allowing rocAL GPU tensor to be exchanged with PyTorch. This allows faster data processing by leveraging DLPack tensors. It also improves the GPU based workload performance. For more details, see [DLpack github reference documentation](https://dmlc.github.io/dlpack/latest/).

## Detailed component changes

The following sections describe key changes to ROCm components.

```{note}
For a historical overview of ROCm component updates, see the {doc}`ROCm consolidated changelog </release/changelog>`.
```

### **AMD SMI** (25.3.0)

#### Added

- Added enumeration mapping `amdsmi_get_gpu_enumeration_info()` to Python and C APIs. The mapping is also enabled in the CLI interface via `amd-smi list -e`.

- Added dynamic virtualization mode detection.
  - Added new C and Python API `amdsmi_get_gpu_virtualization_mode_info`.
  - Added new C and Python enum `amdsmi_virtualization_mode_t`.

- Added TVIOL_ACTIVE to `amd-smi monitor`.

- Added support for GPU metrics 1.7 to `amdsmi_get_gpu_metrics_info()`.

- Added new API `amdsmi_get_gpu_xgmi_link_status()` and CLI `amd-smi xgmi --link-status`.

- Added fclk and socclk info to `amd-smi metric -c/--clock`.

- Added new command `amd-smi set -c/--clock-level`.

- Added new command `amd-smi static -C/--clock`.

#### Changed

- Updated AMD SMI library version number format to reflect changes in backward compatibility and offer more semantic versioning.
  - Removed year from AMD SMI library version number.
  - Version format changed from 25.3.0.0 (Year.Major.Minor.Patch) to 25.3.0 (Major.Minor.Patch).
  - Removed year in all version references.

- Added new Python dependencies: `python3-setuptools` and `python3-wheel`.

- Removed initialization requirements for `amdsmi_get_lib_version()` and added `amdsmi_get_rocm_version()` to the Python API & CLI.

- Added an additional argument `sensor_ind` to `amdsmi_get_power_info()`.
  - This change breaks previous C API calls and will require a change.
  - Python API now accepts `sensor_ind` as an optional argument. This does not impact previous usage.

- Deprecated enum `AMDSMI_NORMAL_STRING_LENGTH` in favor of `AMDSMI_MAX_STRING_LENGTH`.

- Changed to use thread local mutex by default.
  - Most `sysfs` reads do not require cross-process level mutex and writes to `sysfs` should be protected by the kernel already.
  - Users can still switch to the old behavior by setting the environment variable `AMDSMI_MUTEX_CROSS_PROCESS=1`.

- Changed `amdsmi_vram_vendor_type_t` enum names impacting the `amdsmi_vram_info_t` structure. This change also impacts the usage of the `vram_vendor` output of `amdsmi_get_gpu_vram_info()`.

- Changed the `amdsmi_nps_caps_t` struct impacting `amdsmi_memory_partition_config_t`, `amdsmi_accelerator_partition_t`, `amdsmi_accelerator_partition_profile_config_t`.
  Affected functions are:

  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_memory_partition_config()`

  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile()`

  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile_config()`

- Corrected CLI CPU argument name. `--cpu-pwr-svi-telemtry-rails` is now `--cpu-pwr-svi-telemetry-rails`.

- Added amdgpu driver version and amd_hsmp driver version to the `amd-smi version` command.

- All `amd-smi set` and `amd-smi reset` options are now mutually exclusive. You can now only use one `set` option as a time.

- Changed the name of the `power` field to `energy_accumulator` in the Python API for `amdsmi_get_energy_count()`.

- Added violation status output for Graphics Clock Below Host Limit to `amd-smi` CLI: `amdsmi_get_violation_status()`, `amd-smi metric  --throttle`, and `amd-smi monitor --violation`.
  Users can retrieve violation status through either our Python or C++ APIs. Only available for MI300 series+ ASICs.

- Updated API `amdsmi_get_violation_status()` structure and CLI `amdsmi_violation_status_t` to include GFX Clk below host limit.

- Updated API `amdsmi_get_gpu_vram_info()` structure and CLI `amd-smi static --vram`.

#### Removed

- Removed `GFX_BUSY_ACC` from `amd-smi metric --usage` as it did not provide helpful output to users.

#### Optimized

- Added additional help information to `amd-smi set --help` command. The subcommands now detail what values are accepted as input.

- Modified `amd-smi` CLI to allow case insensitive arguments if the argument does not begin with a single dash.

- Converted `xgmi` read and write from KBs to dynamically selected readable units.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info` and `amd-smi static --asic` not displaying graphics version correctly for Instinct MI200 series, Instinct MI100 series, and RDNA3-based GPUs.

#### Known issues

- AMD SMI only reports 63 GPU devices when setting CPX on all 8 GPUs. When setting CPX as a partition mode, there is a DRM node limitation of 64.

This is a known limitation of the Linux kernel; not the driver. Other drivers, such as those using PCIe space (for example, `ast`), might occupy the necessary DRM nodes.  You can check the number of DRM nodes using `ls /sys/class/drm`.

Some workaround options are as follows:

  - Remove other devices occupying DRM nodes.

    Recommended steps for removing unnecessary drivers:

    1. Unload amdgpu - `sudo rmmod amdgpu`.

    2. Remove unnecessary driver(s) - ex. `sudo rmmod ast`.

    3. Reload amgpu - `sudo modprobe amdgpu`.

    4. Confirm `amd-smi list` reports all nodes (this can vary per MI ASIC).

  - Update your OS kernel.

  - Build and install your own kernel.

#### Upcoming changes

- The `AMDSMI_LIB_VERSION_YEAR` enum and API fields will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

- The `pasid` field in struct `amdsmi_process_info_t` will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

### **HIP** (6.4.0)

#### Added

* New HIP APIs

    - `hipDeviceGetTexture1DLinearMaxWidth`  returns the maximum width of elements in a 1D linear texture, which can be allocated on the specified device.
    - `hipStreamBatchMemOp`  enqueues an array of batch memory operations in the stream, for stream synchronization.
    - `hipGraphAddBatchMemOpNode`  creates a batch memory operation node and adds it to a graph.
    - `hipGraphBatchMemOpNodeGetParams`  returns the pointer of parameters from the batch memory operation node.
    - `hipGraphBatchMemOpNodeSetParams`  sets parameters for the batch memory operation node.
    - `hipGraphExecBatchMemOpNodeSetParams`  sets the parameters for a batch memory operation node in the given executable graph.
    - `hipLinkAddData` adds SPIR-V code object data to linker instance with options.
    - `hipLinkAddFile` adds SPIR-V code object file to linker instance with options.
    - `hipLinkCreate`  creates linker instance at runtime with options.
    - `hipLinkComplete` completes linking of program and output linker binary to use with hipModuleLoadData.
    - `hipLinkDestroy`  deletes linker instance.

#### Changed

* `roc-obj` tools is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release.

    - Perl package installation is not required, and users will need to install this themselves if they want to.
    - Support for ROCm Object tooling has moved into `llvm-objdump` provided by package `rocm-llvm`.

* SDMA retainer logic is removed for engine selection in operation of runtime buffer copy.

#### Optimized

* `hipGraphLaunch` parallelism is improved for complex data-parallel graphs.
* Make the round-robin queue selection in command scheduling. For multi-streams execution, HSA queue from null stream lock is freed and won't occupy the queue ID after the kernel in the stream is finished.
* The HIP runtime doesn't free bitcode object before code generation. It adds a cache, which allows compiled code objects to be reused instead of recompiling. This improves performance on multi-GPU systems.
* Runtime now uses unified copy approach:

    - Unpinned `H2D` copies are no longer blocking until the size of 1 MB.
    - Kernel copy path is enabled for unpinned `H2D`/`D2H` methods.
    - The default environment variable `GPU_FORCE_BLIT_COPY_SIZE` is set to `16`, which limits the kernel copy to sizes less than 16 KB, while copies larger than that would be handled by `SDMA` engine.
    - Blit code is refactored, and ASAN instrumentation is cleaned up.

#### Resolved issues

* Out-of-memory error on Microsoft Windows. When the user calls `hipMalloc` for device memory allocation while specifying a size larger than the available device memory, the HIP runtime fixes the error in the API implementation, allocating the available device memory plus system memory (shared virtual memory).
* Error of dependency on `libgcc-s1` during rocm-dev install on Debian Buster. HIP runtime now uses `libgcc1` for this distros.
* Stack corruption during kernel execution. HIP runtime now adds a maximum stack size limit based on the GPU device feature. 

#### Upcoming changes

The following lists the backward incompatible changes planned for upcoming major ROCm releases.

* Signature changes in APIs to correspond with NVIDIA CUDA APIs,

    - `hiprtcCreateProgram`
    - `hiprtcCompileProgram`
    - `hipCtxGetApiVersion`

* Behavior of `hipPointerGetAttributes` is changed to match corresponding CUDA API in version 11 and later releases.
* Return error/value code updates in the following hip APIs to match the corresponding CUDA APIs,

    - `hipModuleLaunchKernel`
    - `hipExtModuleLaunchKernel`
    - `hipModuleLaunchCooperativeKernel`
    - `hipGetTextureAlignmentOffset`
    - `hipTexObjectCreate`
    - `hipBindTexture2D`
    - `hipBindTextureToArray`
    - `hipModuleLoad`
    - `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
    - `hipExtLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`

* HIPRTC implementation, the compilation of `hiprtc` now uses  namespace ` __hip_internal`, instead of the standard headers `std`.
* Stream capture mode updates in the following HIP APIs. Streams can only be captured in relax mode, to match the behavior of the corresponding CUDA APIs,

   - `hipMallocManaged`
   - `hipMemAdvise`
   - `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
   - `hipDeviceSetCacheConfig`
   - `hipDeviceSetSharedMemConfig`
   - `hipMemPoolCreate`
   - `hipMemPoolDestory`
   - `hipDeviceSetMemPool`
   - `hipEventQuery`

* The implementation of `hipStreamAddCallback` is updated, to match the behavior of CUDA.
* Removal of `hiprtc` symbols from hip library.

    - `hiprtc` will be a independent library, and all symbols supported in HIP library are removed.
    - Any application using `hiprtc` APIs should link explicitly with `hiprtc` library.
    - This change makes the use of `hiprtc` library on Linux the same as on Windows, and matches the behavior of CUDA `nvrtc`.

* Removal of deprecated struct `HIP_MEMSET_NODE_PARAMS`, Developers can use definition `hipMemsetParams` instead.

### **hipBLAS** (2.4.0)

#### Changed

* Updated the build dependencies.

### **hipCUB** (3.4.0)

#### Added

* Added regression tests to `rtest.py`. These tests recreate scenarios that have caused hardware problems in past emulation environments. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run these tests.
* Added extended tests to `rtest.py`. These tests are extra tests that did not fit the criteria of smoke and regression tests. These tests will take much longer than smoke and regression tests. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run these tests.
* Added `ForEach`, `ForEachN`, `ForEachCopy`, `ForEachCopyN` and `Bulk` functions to have parity with CUB.
* Added the `hipcub::CubVector` type for CUB parity.
* Added `--emulation` option for `rtest.py`
* Unit tests can be run with `[--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=<test_name>;`.
* Added `DeviceSelect::FlaggedIf` and its inplace overload.
* Added CUB macros missing from hipCUB: `HIPCUB_MAX`, `HIPCUB_MIN`, `HIPCUB_QUOTIENT_FLOOR`, `HIPCUB_QUOTIENT_CEILING`, `HIPCUB_ROUND_UP_NEAREST` and `HIPCUB_ROUND_DOWN_NEAREST`.
* Added `hipcub::AliasTemporaries` function for CUB parity.

#### Changed

* Removed usage of `std::unary_function` and `std::binary_function` in `test_hipcub_device_adjacent_difference.cpp`.
* Changed the subset of tests that are run for smoke tests such that the smoke test will complete with faster run time and never exceed 2 GB of VRAM usage. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* The `rtest.py` options have changed. `rtest.py` is now run with at least either `--test|-t` or `--emulation|-e`, but not both options.
* The NVIDIA backend now requires CUB, Thrust, and libcu++ 2.5.0. If it is not found, it will be downloaded from the NVIDIA CCCL repository.
* Changed the C++ version from 14 to 17. C++14 will be deprecated in the next major release.

#### Known issues

* When building on Microsoft Windows using HIP SDK for ROCm 6.4, ``hipMalloc`` returns ``hipSuccess`` even when the size passed to it is too large and the allocation fails. Because of this, limits have been set for the maximum test case sizes for some unit tests such as HipcubDeviceRadixSort&#39;s SortKeysLargeSizes .

### **hipFFT** (1.0.18)

#### Added

* Implemented the `hipfftMpAttachComm`, `hipfftXtSetDistribution`, and `hipfftXtSetSubformatDefault` APIs to allow
  computing FFTs that are distributed between multiple MPI (Message Passing Interface) processes.  These APIs can be enabled
  with the `HIPFFT_MPI_ENABLE` CMake option, which defaults to `OFF`. The backend FFT library called by hipFFT must support MPI for these APIs to work.

  The backend FFT library called by hipFFT must support MPI for these APIs to work.

#### Changed

* Building with the address sanitizer option sets xnack+ for the relevant GPU
  architectures.
* Use the `find_package` CUDA toolkit instead of CUDA in CMake for modern CMake compatibility.
* The `AMDGPU_TARGETS` build variable should be replaced with `GPU_TARGETS`. `AMDGPU_TARGETS` is deprecated.

#### Resolved issues
* `MIOpen` support in hipify-perl under the `-miopen` option
* Use `const_cast<const char**>` for the last arguments in the `hiprtcCreateProgram` and `hiprtcCompileProgram` function calls, as in CUDA, they are of the `const char* const*` type
* Support for `fp16` device/host API. For more information see [#1769](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/issues/1769) in the HIPIFY Github repository.
* Fixed instructions on building LLVM for HIPIFY on Linux. For more information see [#1800](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/issues/1800) in the HIPIFY Github repository.

#### Known issues

* `hipify-clang` build failure against LLVM 15-18 on `Ubuntu`, `CentOS`, and `Fedora`. For more information see [#833](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/issues/833) in the HIPIFY Github repository.

### **hipRAND** (2.12.0)

#### Changed

* When building hipRAND on Windows, use `HIP_PATH` (instead of the former `HIP_DIR`) to specify the path to the HIP SDK installation.
* When building with the `rmake.py` script, `HIP_PATH` will default to `C:\hip` if it is not set.
  
#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue causing hipRAND build failures on Windows when the HIP SDK was installed in a location with a path that contains spaces.

### **hipSOLVER** (2.4.0)

#### Added

* The `csrlsvqr` compatibility-only functions `hipsolverSpScsrlsvqr`, `hipsolverSpDcsrlsvqr`, `hipsolverSpCcsrlsvqr`, `hipsolverSpZcsrlsvqr`

### **hipSPARSE** (3.2.0)

#### Added

#### Resolved issues

* For a CMake bug workaround, set `CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH` when `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` is unset.

#### Upcoming changes
 
* hipTensor will enhance performance and usability while unifying the API design across all operations (elementwise, reductions, and tensor contractions), enabling consistent multi-stage execution and plan reuse. As part of this change, the API functions `hiptensorInitTensorDescriptor`, `hiptensorContractionDescriptor_t` , `hiptensorInitContractionDescriptor`, `hiptensorInitContractionFind`, `hiptensorContractionGetWorkspaceSize`, `hiptensorInitContractionPlan`, `hiptensorContraction`, `hiptensorElementwiseBinary`, `hiptensorElementwiseTrinary`, `hiptensorPermutation`, and `hiptensorReduction` will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

### **llvm-project** (19.0.0)

#### Added

* Support for `amdgpu_max_num_work_groups` in the compiler. This attribute
  can be set by end users or library developers. It provides an upper limit
  for workgroups as described in [AMD GPU Attributes](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#amdgpu-max-num-work-groups).
  When set, the AMDGPU target backend might produce better machine code.

#### Changed

* The name reported for detected agents is now based on the `amdgpu.ids` database provided by `libdrm`.

### **rocDecode** (0.10.0)

#### Added

* The new bitstream reader feature has been added. The bitstream reader contains built-in stream file parsers, including an elementary stream file parser and an IVF container file parser. The reader can parse AVC, HEVC, and AV1 elementary stream files, and AV1 IVF container files. Additional supported formats will be added.
* VP9 support has been added.
* More CTests have been added: VP9 test and tests on video decode raw sample.
* Two new samples, videodecoderaw and videodecodepicfiles, have been added. videodecoderaw uses the bitstream reader instead of the FFMPEG demuxer to get picture data, and videodecodepicfiles shows how to decode an elementary video stream stored in multiple files, with each file containing bitstream data of a coded picture.

#### Changed

* AMD Clang++ is now the default CXX compiler.
* Moved MD5 code out of the RocVideoDecode utility.

#### Removed

* FFMPEG executable requirement for the package.

### **rocFFT** (1.0.32)

#### Changed

#### Removed

* Ahead-of-time compiled kernels for the gfx906, gfx940, and gfx941 architectures. These architectures still work the same way, but their kernels are now compiled at runtime.
* Consumer GPU architectures from the precompiled kernel cache that ships with
  rocFFT. rocFFT continues to ship with a cache of precompiled RTC kernels for data center
  and workstation architectures. As before, user-level caches can be enabled by setting the
  environment variable `ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH` to a writeable file location.

#### Optimized

* Improved MPI transform performance by using all-to-all communication for global transpose operations.  
  Point-to-point communications are still used when all-to-all is unavailable.
* Improved the performance of unit-strided, complex interleaved, forward, and inverse length (64,64,64) FFTs.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed incorrect results from 2-kernel 3D FFT plans that used non-default output strides. For more information, see the [rocFFT GitHub issue](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT/issues/507).

### **rocPRIM** (3.4.0)

#### Added

* The parallel `find_first_of` device function with autotuned configurations has been added. This function is similar to `std::find_first_of`. It searches for the first occurrence of any of the provided elements.
* Tuned configurations for segmented radix sort for gfx942 have been added to improve performance on the gfx942 architecture.
* The parallel device-level function, `rocprim::adjacent_find`, which is similar to the C++ Standard Library `std::adjacent_find` algorithm, has been added.
* Configuration autotuning has been added to device adjacent find (`rocprim::adjacent_find`) for improved performance on selected architectures.
* `rocprim::numeric_limits` has been added. This is an extension of `std::numeric_limits` that supports 128-bit integers.
* `rocprim::int128_t` and `rocprim::uint128_t` have been added. 
* The parallel `search` and `find_end` device functions have been added. These are similar to `std::search` and `std::find_end`. These functions search for the first and last occurrence of the sequence, respectively.
* A parallel device-level function, `rocprim::search_n`, has been added. `rocprim::search_n` is similar to the C++ Standard Library `std::search_n` algorithm.
* New constructors, a `base` function, and a `constexpr` specifier have been added to all functions in `rocprim::reverse_iterator` to improve parity with the C++17 `std::reverse_iterator`.
* hipGraph support has been added to the device run-length-encode for non-trivial runs (`rocprim::run_length_encode_non_trivial_runs`).
* Configuration autotuning has been added to the device run-length-encode for non-trivial runs (`rocprim::run_length_encode_non_trivial_runs`) for improved performance on selected architectures.
* Configuration autotuning has been added to the device run-length-encode for trivial runs (`rocprim::run_length_encode`) for improved performance on selected architectures.
* The `--emulation` option has been added to `rtest.py`. Unit tests can be run with `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=<test_name>`.
* Extended and regression tests have been added to `rtest.py`. Extended tests are tests that don't fit the criteria of smoke or regression tests, and take longer than smoke or regression tests to run. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run extended tests, and `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run regression tests.
* Added a new type traits interface to enable users to provide additional type trait information to rocPRIM, facilitating better compatibility with custom types.

#### Changed

* Changed the subset of tests that are run for smoke tests such that the smoke test will complete faster and never exceed 2 GB of VRAM usage. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* The `rtest.py` options have changed. `rtest.py` is now run with at least either `--test|-t` or `--emulation|-e`, but not both options.
* Changed the internal algorithm of block radix sort to use a rank match. This improves the performance of various radix sort-related algorithms.
* Disabled padding in various cases where higher occupancy resulted in better performance despite more bank conflicts.
* The C++ version has changed from 14 to 17. C++14 will be deprecated in the next major release.
* You can use CMake HIP language support with CMake 3.18 and later. To use HIP language support, run `cmake` with `-DUSE_HIPCXX=ON` instead of setting the `CXX` variable to the path to a HIP-aware compiler.

#### Removed

* HIP-CPU support

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where `rmake.py` generated incorrect cmake commands in a Linux environment.
* Fixed an issue where `rocprim::partial_sort_copy` would yield a compile error if the input iterator was a const.
* Fixed incorrect 128-bit signed and unsigned integer type traits.
* Fixed a compilation issue when `rocprim::radix_key_codec<...>` is specialized with a 128-bit integer.
* Fixed the warp-level reduction `rocprim::warp_reduce.reduce` DPP implementation to avoid undefined intermediate values during the reduction.
* Fixed an issue that caused a segmentation fault when `hipStreamLegacy` was passed to certain API functions.

#### Upcoming changes

* Using the initialization constructor of `rocprim::reverse_iterator` will throw a deprecation warning. It will be marked as explicit in the next major release.

* `reduce()` operation for counter expression with respect to dimension.
* `--collection-period` feature in `rocprofv3` to enable filtering using time.
* `--collection-period-unit` feature in `rocprofv3` to control time units used in the collection period option.
* Deprecation notice for ROCProfiler and ROCProfilerV2.
* Support for rocDecode API Tracing.
* Usage documentation for ROCTx.
* Usage documentation for MPI applications.
* SDK: `rocprofiler_agent_v0_t` support for agent UUIDs.

#### Resolved issues

* Ubuntu 24.04 compile failure with FFmpeg version 5.X and above has been fixed.

### **rocRAND** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* Extended tests to `rtest.py`. These tests are extra tests that did not fit the criteria of smoke and regression tests. They take much longer to run relative to smoke and regression tests. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run these tests.
* Added regression tests to `rtest.py`. These tests recreate scenarios that have caused hardware problems in past emulation environments. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run these tests.
* Added smoke test options, which run a subset of the unit tests and ensure that less than 2 GB of VRAM will be used. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* The `--emulation` option for `rtest.py`.

#### Changed

* `--test|-t` is no longer a required flag for `rtest.py`. Instead, the user can use either `--emulation|-e` or `--test|-t`, but not both.
* Removed the TBB dependency for multi-core processing of host-side generation.

### **ROCr Debug Agent** (2.0.4)

#### Added

* Functionality to print the associated kernel name for each wave.

### **ROCr Runtime** (1.15.0)

#### Added

* Support for asynchronous scratch reclaim on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Asynchronous scratch reclaim allows scratch memory that was assigned to Command Processor(cp) queues to be reclaimed back in case the application runs out of device memory or if the `hsa_amd_agent_set_async_scratch_limit` API is called with the threshold parameter as 0.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.28.0)

#### Added

* Application of a sequence of plane rotations to a given matrix for LASR
* Algorithm selection mechanism for hybrid computation
* Hybrid computation support for existing routines:
    - BDSQR
    - GESVD

#### Optimized

* Improved the performance of SYEVJ.
* Improved the performance of GEQRF.

### **rocSPARSE** (3.4.0)

#### Added

* Added support for `rocsparse_matrix_type_triangular` in `rocsparse_spsv`.
* Added test filters `smoke`, `regression`, and `extended` for emulation tests.
* Added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute_ex` routines for iterative ILU.
* Added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve_ex` routines for iterative triangular solve.
* Added `GPU_TARGETS` to replace the now deprecated `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in CMake files.
* Added BSR format to the SpMM generic routine `rocsparse_spmm`.

#### Changed

* By default, the rocSPARSE shared library is built using the `--offload-compress` compiler option which compresses the fat binary. This significantly reduces the shared library binary size.

#### Optimized

* Improved the performance of `rocsparse_spmm` when used with row order for `B` and `C` dense matrices and the row split algorithm `rocsparse_spmm_alg_csr_row_split`.
* Improved the adaptive CSR sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithm when the sparse matrix has many empty rows at the beginning or at the end of the matrix. This improves the routines `rocsparse_spmv` and `rocsparse_spmv_ex` when the adaptive algorithm `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_adaptive` is used.
* Improved stream CSR sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithm when the sparse matrix size (number of rows) decreases. This improves the routines `rocsparse_spmv` and `rocsparse_spmv_ex` when the stream algorithm `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_stream` is used.
* Compared to `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute`, the routines `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute_ex` introduce several free iterations. A free iteration is an iteration that does not compute the evaluation of the stopping criteria, if enabled. This allows the user to tune the algorithm for performance improvements.
* Compared to `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve`, the routines `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve_ex` introduce several free iterations. A free iteration is an iteration that does not compute the evaluation of the stopping criteria. This allows the user to tune the algorithm for performance improvements.
* Improved the user documentation.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rocsparse_spgemm`, `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csrgemm`, and `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]bsrgemm` where incorrect results could be produced when rocSPARSE was built with optimization level `O0`. This was caused by a bug in the hash tables that could allow keys to be inserted twice.
* Fixed an issue in the routine `rocsparse_spgemm` when using `rocsparse_spgemm_stage_symbolic` and `rocsparse_spgemm_stage_numeric`, where the routine would crash when `alpha` and `beta` were passed as host pointers and where `beta != 0`.
* Fixed an issue in `rocsparse_bsrilu0`, where the algorithm was running out of bounds of the `bsr_val` array.

#### Upcoming changes

* Deprecated the `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute` routines. Users should use the newly added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute_ex` routines going forward.
* Deprecated the `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve` routines. Users should use the newly added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve_ex` routines going forward.
* Deprecated the use of `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in CMake files. Users should use `GPU_TARGETS` going forward.

### **ROCTracer** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* Tool deprecation message for ROCTracer.

### **rocThrust** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* Added a section to install Thread Building Block (TBB) inside `cmake/Dependencies.cmake` if TBB is not already available.
* Made TBB an optional dependency with the new `BUILD_HIPSTDPAR_TEST_WITH_TBB` flag. When the flag is `OFF` and TBB is not already on the machine, it will compile without TBB. Otherwise, it will compile with TBB.
* Added extended tests to `rtest.py`. These tests are extra tests that did not fit the criteria of smoke and regression tests. These tests will take much longer than smoke and regression tests. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run these tests.
* Added regression tests to `rtest.py`. These tests recreate scenarios that have caused hardware problems in past emulation environments. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run these tests.
* Added smoke test options, which run a subset of the unit tests and ensure that less than 2 GB of VRAM will be used. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* Added `--emulation` option for `rtest.py`
* Merged changes from upstream CCCL/thrust 2.4.0 and CCCL/thrust 2.5.0.
* Added `find_first_of`, `find_end`, `search`, and `search_n` to HIPSTDPAR.
* Updated HIPSTDPAR's `adjacent_find` to use the rocPRIM implementation.

#### Changed

* Changed the C++ version from 14 to 17. C++14 will be deprecated in the next major release.
* `--test|-t` is no longer a required flag for `rtest.py`. Instead, the user can use either `--emulation|-e` or `--test|-t`, but not both.
* Split HIPSTDPAR's forwarding header into several implementation headers.
* Fixed `copy_if` to work with large data types (512 bytes).

#### Known issues

*  `thrust::inclusive_scan_by_key` might produce incorrect results when it's used with -O2 or -O3 optimization.  This is caused by a recent compiler change and a fix will be made available at a later date.

### **rocWMMA** (1.7.0)

#### Added

* Added interleaved layouts that enhance the performance of GEMM operations.
* Emulation test suites. These suites are lightweight and well suited for execution on emulator platforms.

#### Changed

* Used `GPU_TARGETS` instead of `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in `cmakelists.txt`.
* Binary sizes can be reduced on supported compilers by using the `--offload-compress` compiler flag.

#### Resolved issues

* For a CMake bug workaround, set `CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH` when `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` is unset.

#### Upcoming changes
 
* rocWMMA will augment the fragment API objects with additional meta-properties that improve API expressiveness and configurability of parameters including multiple-wave cooperation. As part of this change, cooperative rocWMMA API functions `load_matrix_coop_sync` and `store_matrix_coop_sync` will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

### **rpp** (1.9.10)

#### Added

* RPP Tensor Gaussian Filter and Tensor Box Filter support on HOST (CPU) backend.

## ROCm known issues

ROCm known issues are noted on {fab}`github` [GitHub](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/labels/Verified%20Issue). For known
issues related to individual components, review the [Detailed component changes](#detailed-component-changes).

### Systems with a display GPU and eight AMD Instinct MI300 series GPUs reboot when loading the AMDGPU driver

Due to limitations in older `libdrm` libraries, you might not be able to use an AMD Instinct MI300 series GPUs with a display GPU on a single server. This limitation means there can only be a maximum of 64 DRM devices at any time, regardless of vendor. When attempting to initialize all DRM device modules, the kernel will PANIC on the 65th DRM device, resulting in a system reboot. This issue will be properly fixed when resolved in `libdrm` libraries and the Linux kernel, to be distributed by the OS per their release schedules. Remove the non-AMD Instinct MI300 series GPUs as a workaround, or add the following in the GRUB setting for the onboard modules.

```bash
modprobe.blacklist=$MODULE
```
For Example:

* For Aspeed, use:
```bash
modprobe.blacklist=ast
```
* For Mellanox, use:
```bash
modprobe.blacklist=mgag200
```

### Failure when using a generic target with compression and vice versa

In ROCm 6.4.0, compilation for generic target with compression will fail. As a result, you won't be able to compile for a generic target and use compression simultaneously. As a workaround, it's recommended not to use compression when using generic targets and vice versa. This issue will be addressed in a future ROCm release.

### GFX Freq information is unavailable in the rocm-smi when running in SRIOV mode enabled on MI210

In ROCm 6.4.0, you cannot see the GFX Freq information in the guest VM. In SRIOV mode, the AMD Platform Management Firmware (PMFW) does not share the graphics frequency information with the guest VMs and is only available to Host systems. This issue will be addressed in a future ROCm release.

### Failure to use --kokkos-trace option in ROCm Compute Profiler

In ROCm 6.4.0, it’s not recommended to use the `--kokkos-trace` option. `--kokkos-trace` has been partially implemented in the `rocprofv3` tool, resulting in a difference between the output of `--kokkos-trace` and the `counter_collection.csv` output file. The program will exit with a warning message if the `-kokkos-trace` option is detected in the ROCm Compute Profiler. The issue will be addressed in a future ROCm release.

### Compute partition modification is restricted with concurrent operations running in parallel
 
Modification to compute partition in GPU is prohibited by design while concurrent operations run in parallel. You must ensure no concurrent operations on the device are running when attempting to modify the compute partitions. Additional checks and error messaging to inform users of correct operation for partition modification are planned for future ROCm releases.

### MIOpen generates incorrect results for particular input with FP32 data type

In ROCm 6.4.0, MIOpen generates incorrect results on the `conv2dbackward` function for a particular input with 32-bit floating point (FP32) data types. The issue is only specific to FP32 data types with 2 * 2 kernel size and dilation 2 * 1. As a workaround, change the data type from FP32 to FP16. The issue will be addressed in a future ROCm release.  

### ROCm Debugger (ROCgdb) might not work correctly on the AMD Radeon PRO W6800 SR-IOV virtualization environment

The ROCm Debugger (ROCgdb) component needs access to some registers to fetch debugging information. These registers are blocked in the AMD Radeon PRO W6800 SR-IOV virtualization environment, resulting in the ROCm Debugger (ROCgdb) being non-functional. The issue is due to the limitation in the virtualization environment and isn't specific to ROCm. Further investigation is in progress.

### Limited support for Sparse API and Pallas functionality in JAX

In ROCm 6.4.0, due to limited support for Sparse API in JAX, some of the functionality of the Pallas extension is restricted. This results in issues porting existing workloads. The issue will be addressed in a future ROCm release.

### Inconsistent log probabilities when using the Mixtral 8x7B model in vLLM and SGLang framework

In ROCm 6.4.0, using a Mixtral 8X7B model with different tensor parallelism (TP) sizes in the vLLM and SGLang framework might result in inconsistent log probabilities. While the output token IDs remain consistent across various TP configurations (1, 2, 4, 8), the log probabilities associated with these tokens might vary. The inconsistency might occur despite using identical quantization settings, prompts, and greedy sampling strategies. The behavior has been observed across different GPUs and is a known limitation in both frameworks, as evidenced by multiple GitHub issues. 

The inconsistency primarily impacts the applications that rely on consistent log probabilities, such as those involving uncertainty estimation or probabilistic decision-making. This known limitation results from how TP distributes computations across multiple GPUs, resulting in slight variations in floating-point arithmetic. Currently, there is no direct resolution as this is a framework-level characteristic rather than a defect.

As a workaround, you can standardize the TP sizes across all the deployments to minimize the inconsistency in the log probabilities. For information on the resolution of this inconsistency in the future, see the [SGlang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) and [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) GitHub repositories. 

### No module named more_itertools warning on Azure Linux 3

During the driver installation process on Azure Linux 3, you might encounter the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'more_itertools'` warning. This warning is a result of the reintroduction of `python3-wheel` and `python3-setuptools` dependencies in the CMake of `amdsmi`, which requires `more_itertools` to build these Python libraries . This issue will be fixed in a future ROCm release. As a workaround, use the following command before installation.

```
sudo python3 -m pip install more_itertools
```

### Rare occurrence of AMDGPU driver failing to load in a VM on Quanta system

In a rare occurrence (1 in 500 reboots), the guest kernel might display the call trace due to the AMDGPU driver failing to load in a repeated power cycle virtual machine (VM) on a Quanta system. This issue will limit you from using the AMD GPUs in the guest kernel. As a workaround, reboot the VM to avoid the failure.

### Clang compilation failure might occur due to incorrectly installed GNU C++ runtime

Clang compilation failure with the error `fatal error: 'cmath' file not found` might occur if the GNU C++ runtime is not installed correctly. The error indicates that the `libstdc++-dev` package, compatible with the latest installed GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version, is missing. This issue is a result of Clang being unable to find the newest GNU C++ runtimes it recognizes and the associated header files. As a workaround, install the `libstdc++-dev` package compatible with the installed GCC version.

### ROCProfiler with rocprof might fail to initialize in some PyTorch applications

In some PyTorch applications, the `HSA_TOOLS_LIB` environment variable might fail to initialize the ROCProfiler library with the `rocprof` tool. As a result of the issue, `--stats` and the counter collection commands might fail to trace the execution of the application and collect hardware component performance during kernel execution, respectively. The issue might have originated from a change in the PyTorch library, causing an overwrite in the `HSA_TOOLS_LIB` environment variable. This issue will be fixed in a future ROCm release. However, consider that ROCprofiler and `rocprof` are being phased out in favor of ROCprofiler-SDK in upcoming ROCm releases. For details, see [ROCm upcoming changes](#roctracer-rocprofiler-rocprof-and-rocprofv2-deprecation).
As a workaround, add the following to the command you are running:

```
LD_PRELOAD=/opt/rocm-6.x.x/lib/librocprofiler64.so.1.
```

Alternatively, you can modify the `rocprof` script located at `/opt/rocm-6.x.x/bin/rocprof` by adding the following in line #96:

```
ROCPROFV1_LD_PRELOAD=$MY_HSA_TOOLS_LIB
```

### Applications using HIP runtime might stop the graph capture process

Applications using the HIP runtime might stop the graph capture process if the HIP runtime detects an invalid stale state from a previous capture on the same HIP stream. Resetting the stale set for every new capture in the HIP runtime can resolve the issue. The issue will be fixed in a future ROCm release.

### Incorrect computation results in hipBLASLt for specific transpose configuration

When running the hipBLASLt library using the transpose configuration (TT) with FP32 and XF32 data types, you might receive incorrect computation results. As a workaround, select alternative solutions from the list returned by `hipblasLtMatmulAlgoGetHeuristic()`. Verify the result to identify the correct alternative solution. The issue will be fixed in a future ROCm release.

### Incorrect result in RCCL when using LL protocol in graph mode with MSCCL++ enabled

In RCCL library, you might receive incorrect results in All-Reduce collective API, when using Link Layer (LL) protocol in graph mode while MSCCL++ is enabled. This issue occurs when the protocal state information are updated in the host-side code instead of in a kernel, which is not supported in graph mode. As a workaround, you can disable MSCCL++ by setting the environment variable `RCCL_MSCCLPP_ENABLE=0`. However, consider that this might negatively impact the performance. The issue will be fixed in a future ROCm release. 

## ROCm resolved issues

The following are previously known issues resolved in this release. For resolved issues related to
individual components, review the [Detailed component changes](#detailed-component-changes).

### PCI Express Qualification Tool failure on Debian 12

Fixed the issue of the PCI Express Qualification Tool (PEQT) module present in the ROCm Validation Suite (RVS) failing due to the segmentation issue in Debian 12 (bookworm). The fix now allows you to determine the characteristics of the PCIe interconnect between the host platform and the GPU like support for Gen 3 atomic completers, DMA transfer statistics, link speed, and link width. See [GitHub issue #4175](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4175).

### Transformer Engine test_distributed_fused_attn aborts with fatal Python error

Fixed the issue of the `test_distributed_fused_attn` Pytest case for JAX in [Transformer Engine
for ROCm](https://github.com/ROCm/TransformerEngine) failing with a fatal Python
error under certain conditions. The root cause was unrelated to Transformer Engine
but due to some issue within XLA. The fix has now been implemented in XLA. See [GitHub issue #4087](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4087).

## ROCm upcoming changes

The following changes to the ROCm software stack are anticipated for future releases.

### ROCm SMI deprecation

[ROCm SMI](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib) will be phased out in an
upcoming ROCm release and will enter maintenance mode. After this transition,
only critical bug fixes will be addressed and no further feature development
will take place.
 
It's strongly recommended to transition your projects to [AMD
SMI](https://github.com/ROCm/amdsmi), the successor to ROCm SMI. AMD SMI
includes all the features of the ROCm SMI and will continue to receive regular
updates, new functionality, and ongoing support. For more information on AMD
SMI, see the [AMD SMI documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/amdsmi/en/latest/).

### ROCTracer, ROCProfiler, rocprof, and rocprofv2 deprecation

Development and support for ROCTracer, ROCProfiler, `rocprof`, and `rocprofv2` are being phased out in favor of ROCprofiler-SDK in upcoming ROCm releases. Starting with ROCm 6.4, only critical defect fixes will be addressed for older versions of the profiling tools and libraries. All users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of the ROCprofiler-SDK library and the (`rocprofv3`) tool to ensure continued support and access to new features. ROCprofiler-SDK is still in beta today and will be production-ready in a future ROCm release.
 
It's anticipated that ROCTracer, ROCProfiler, `rocprof`, and `rocprofv2` will reach end-of-life by future releases, aligning with Q1 of 2026.

### AMDGPU wavefront size compiler macro deprecation

Access to the wavefront size as a compile-time constant via the `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE`
and `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE__` macros or the `constexpr warpSize` variable is deprecated
and will be disabled in a future release. 

* The `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE__` macro and `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE` alias will be removed in an upcoming release.
  It is recommended to remove any use of this macro. For more information, see
  [AMDGPU support](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/llvm-project/en/docs-6.3.2/LLVM/clang/html/AMDGPUSupport.html).
* `warpSize` will only be available as a non-`constexpr` variable. Where required,
  the wavefront size should be queried via the `warpSize` variable in device code,
  or via `hipGetDeviceProperties` in host code. Neither of these will result in a compile-time constant. 
* For cases where compile-time evaluation of the wavefront size cannot be avoided,
  uses of `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE`, `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE__`, or `warpSize`
  can be replaced with a user-defined macro or `constexpr` variable with the wavefront
  size(s) for the target hardware. For example: 

```
   #if defined(__GFX9__)
   #define MY_MACRO_FOR_WAVEFRONT_SIZE 64
   #else
   #define MY_MACRO_FOR_WAVEFRONT_SIZE 32
   #endif
```

### HIPCC Perl scripts deprecation

The HIPCC Perl scripts (`hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`) will be removed in an upcoming release.

### Changes to ROCm Object Tooling

ROCm Object Tooling tools ``roc-obj-ls``, ``roc-obj-extract``, and ``roc-obj`` are
deprecated in ROCm 6.4, and will be removed in a future release. Functionality
has been added to the ``llvm-objdump --offloading`` tool option to extract all
clang-offload-bundles into individual code objects found within the objects
or executables passed as input.  The ``llvm-objdump --offloading`` tool option also
supports the ``--arch-name`` option, and only extracts code objects found with
the specified target architecture. See [llvm-objdump](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-objdump.html)
for more information. 

### HIP runtime API changes
 
There are a number of upcoming changes planned for HIP runtime API in an upcoming major release 
that are not backward compatible with prior releases. Most of these changes increase 
alignment between HIP and CUDA APIs or behavior. Some of the upcoming changes are to 
clean up header files, remove namespace collision, and have a clear separation between 
`hipRTC` and HIP runtime. For more information refer to [HIP Upcoming changes](#hip-6-4-0).
