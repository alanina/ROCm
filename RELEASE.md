### ROCm Compute Profiler updates

ROCm Compute Profiler has the following enhancements:

* Single‑Pass Counter Collection feature has been added. It allows profiling kernels in a single pass using a predefined metric set, reducing profiling overhead and session time.
* Dynamic process attachment feature has been added. It allows starting or stopping profiling on a running application without restarting, enabling flexible analysis for long‑running jobs.
* Enhanced TUI Experience feature has been added. It allows for interactive exploration of metrics with descriptions and view high‑level compute and memory throughput panels for quick insights.

### ROCm Systems Profiler updates

ROCm Systems Profiler has the following enhancements:

* Validated support for virtualized Hyper-V environment, JAX AI framework, and PyTorch AI framework.
* Transitioned to using AMD SMI by default, instead of ROCm SMI.
* Integrated with ROCm Profiling Data (rocpd), enabling profiling results to be stored in a SQLite3 database. This provides a structured and efficient foundation for in-depth analysis and post-processing.

### ROCprofiler-SDK updates

ROCprofiler-SDK and `rocprofv3` include the following enhancements:

* Dynamic process attachment feature has been added. This feature in ROCprofiler-SDK and `rocprofv3` allows dynamic profiling of a running GPU application by attaching to its process ID (PID), rather than launching the application through the profiler itself. This allows real-time data collection without interrupting execution, making it ideal for profiling long-running, containerized, or multiprocess workloads. For more details, refer to [Dynamic process attachment](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/how-to/using-rocprofv3-process-attachment.html) documentation for `rocprofv3` and [Implementing Process Attachment Tools](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/api-reference/process_attachment.html) for `ROCprofiler-SDK`.
* Scratch-memory trace information has been added to the Perfetto output in `rocprofv3`, enhancing visibility into memory usage during profiling. Additionally, derived metrics and the required counters have been successfully integrated for gfx12XX series GPUs, enabling users to collect performance counters through `rocprofv3` on these platforms.
* Host-trap (software-based) PC sampling is now available on RDNA4 architecture-based gfx12xx series GPUs. It uses the kernel threads to interrupt GPU waves and capture PC states. For more details, see [Using PC sampling](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/how-to/using-pc-sampling.html).
* Real-time clock support has been added to the thread trace in `rocprofv3` for thread trace alignment on gfx9xx GPUs, enabling high-resolution clock computation and better synchronization across shader engines. 
* `MultiKernelDispatch` thread trace support is now available across all ASICs, allowing users to profile multiple kernel dispatches within a single thread trace session. This enhances the timeline accuracy and enables deeper analysis of concurrent GPU workloads.
* Stability and robustness of the `rocpd` output format for `rocprofv3` has been improved. For details, see [Using rocpd output format](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-sdk/en/latest/how-to/using-rocpd-output-format.html).

### Device-side assertion support and atomic metadata control in Clang

ROCm 7.1.0 introduces two key compiler enhancements:

* Device-compatible assertions: A ``__device__`` version of
  ``std::__glibcxx_assert_fail()`` has been added to enable the use of ``std::array`` and
  other libstdc++ features in device code. This resolves previous compilation
  failures caused by non-constexpr host assertions being invoked from device
  contexts.

* Clang atomic metadata attribute: The new ``[[clang::atomic]]`` statement
  attribute allows fine-grained control over how atomic operations are lowered in
  LLVM IR. Users can specify memory types (for example, ``remote_memory``,
  ``fine_grained_memory``) and floating-point behavior (``ignore_denormal_mode``) to
  optimize performance without compromising correctness. These attributes can
  override global compiler flags on a per-block basis, improving atomic operation
  efficiency on architectures like AMDGPU.

### Deep learning and AI framework updates

ROCm provides a comprehensive ecosystem for deep learning development. For more information, see [Deep learning frameworks for ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-7.0.2/how-to/deep-learning-rocm.html) and the [Compatibility
matrix](../../docs/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.rst) for the complete list of Deep learning and AI framework versions tested for compatibility with ROCm.

#### TensorFlow
ROCm 7.1.0 enables support for TensorFlow 2.20.0.

### ROCm Offline Installer Creator updates

The ROCm Offline Installer Creator 7.1.0 includes the following features and improvements:
 
* Added support for creating an offline installer for RHEL 8.10, 9.4, 9.6, and 10.0 where the kernel version of the target OS differs from the host OS creating the installer.

* Fixes an issue in the Debian 13 Docker that prevented users from creating a driver install package using the default Docker kernel driver.
 
See [ROCm Offline Installer Creator](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/rocm-offline-installer.html) for more information.
 
### ROCm Runfile Installer updates
 
The ROCm Runfile Installer 7.1.0 fixes warnings that occurred with rocm-examples testing.
 
For more information, see [ROCm Runfile Installer](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/install/rocm-runfile-installer.html).

### End of Support for ROCm Execution Provider (ROCm-EP)

ROCm 7.1.0 marks the End of Support (EOS) for ROCm Execution Provider (ROCm-EP). ROCm 7.0.2 was the last official AMD-supported distribution of ROCm-EP. Refer to this [Pull Request](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/25181) for more information. Migrate your applications to use the [MIGraphX Execution Provider](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/MIGraphX-ExecutionProvider.html#migraphx-execution-provider).

### ROCm documentation updates

ROCm documentation continues to be updated to provide clearer and more comprehensive guidance for a wider variety of user needs and use cases.

* [Tutorials for AI developers](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ai-developer-hub/en/latest/) have been expanded with the following two new tutorials:
    * Pretraining tutorial: [Speculative decoding draft model with SpecForge](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ai-developer-hub/en/latest/notebooks/pretrain/SpecForge_SGlang.html)
    * GPU development and optimization tutorial: [Quark MXFP4 quantization for vLLM](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ai-developer-hub/en/latest/notebooks/gpu_dev_optimize/mxfp4_quantization_quark_vllm.html)

    For more information about the changes, see [Changelog for the AI Developer Hub](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ai-developer-hub/en/latest/changelog.html).

* ROCm components support a wide range of environment variables that can be used for testing, logging, debugging, experimental features, and more. The [rocBLAS](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocBLAS/en/docs-7.0.2/reference/env-variables.html) and [RCCL](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rccl/en/docs-7.0.2/api-reference/env-variables.html) components have been updated with new environment variable content.

* The [HIP documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/index.html) introduces a new tutorial that shows you how to transform your GPU applications from repeated direction to choreographed performance with HIP graphs. HIP graphs model dependencies between operations as nodes and edges on a diagram. Each node in the graph represents an operation, and each edge represents a dependency between two nodes. For more information, see [HIP graphs](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/docs-develop/how-to/hip_runtime_api/hipgraph.html#how-to-hip-graph) and [HIP Graph API Tutorial](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/docs-develop/tutorial/graph_api.html).

## Detailed component changes

The following sections describe key changes to ROCm components.

```{note}
For a historical overview of ROCm component updates, see the {doc}`ROCm consolidated changelog </release/changelog>`.
```

### **AMD SMI** (26.1.0)

#### Added

* `GPU LINK PORT STATUS` table to `amd-smi xgmi` command. The `amd-smi xgmi -s` or `amd-smi xgmi --source-status` will now show the `GPU LINK PORT STATUS` table.  

* `amdsmi_get_gpu_revision()` to Python API. This function retrieves the GPU revision ID. Available in `amdsmi_interface.py` as `amdsmi_get_gpu_revision()`.

* Gpuboard and baseboard temperatures to `amd-smi metric` command.

#### Changed

* Struct `amdsmi_topology_nearest_t` member `processor_list`. Member size changed, processor_list[AMDSMI_MAX_DEVICES * AMDSMI_MAX_NUM_XCP].

* `amd-smi reset --profile` behavior so that it won't also reset the performance level.  
  * The performance level can still be reset using `amd-smi reset --perf-determinism`.  

* Setting power cap is now available in Linux Guest. You can now use `amd-smi set --power-cap` as usual in Linux Guest systems too.

* Changed `amd-smi static --vbios` to `amd-smi static --ifwi`.  
  * VBIOS naming is replaced with IFWI (Integrated Firmware Image) for improved clarity and consistency.
  * AMD Instinct MI300 Series GPUs (and later) now use a new version format with enhanced build information.
  * Legacy command `amd-smi static --vbios` remains functional for backward compatibility, but displays updated IFWI heading.
  * The Python, C, and Rust API for `amdsmi_get_gpu_vbios_version()` will now have a new field called `boot_firmware`, which will return the legacy vbios version number that is also known as the Unified BootLoader (UBL) version.

#### Optimized

* Optimized the way `amd-smi process` validates, which processes are running on a GPU. 

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed a CPER record count mismatch issue when using the `amd-smi ras --cper --file-limit`. Updated the deletion calculation to use `files_to_delete = len(folder_files) - file_limit` for exact file count management.

* Fixed the event monitoring segfaults causing RDC to crash. Added the mutex locking around access to device event notification file pointer.

* Fixed an issue where using `amd-smi ras --folder <folder_name>` was forcing the created folder's name to be lowercase. This fix also makes all string input options case-insensitive.

* Fixed certain output in `amd-smi monitor` when GPUs are partitioned. It fixes the issue with amd-smi monitor such as: `amd-smi monitor -Vqt`, `amd-smi monitor -g 0 -Vqt -w 1`, and `amd-smi monitor -Vqt --file /tmp/test1`. These commands will now be able to display as normal in partitioned GPU scenarios.

```

### **Composable Kernel** (1.1.0)

#### Added
 
* Support for hdim as a multiple of 32 for FMHA (fwd/fwd_splitkv/bwd).
* Support for elementwise kernel.
 
#### Upcoming changes
 
* Non-grouped convolutions are deprecated. Their functionality is supported by grouped convolution.

### **HIP** (7.1.0)

#### Added

* New HIP APIs
    - `hipModuleGetFunctionCount` returns the number of functions within a module
    - `hipMemsetD2D8` used for setting 2D memory range with specified 8-bit values
    - `hipMemsetD2D8Async` used for setting 2D memory range with specified 8-bit values asynchronously
    - `hipMemsetD2D16` used for setting 2D memory range with specified 16-bit values
    - `hipMemsetD2D16Async` used for setting 2D memory range with specified 16-bit values asynchronously
    - `hipMemsetD2D32` used for setting 2D memory range with specified 32-bit values
    - `hipMemsetD2D32Async` used for setting 2D memory range with specified 32-bit values asynchronously
    - `hipStreamSetAttribute` sets attributes such as synchronization policy for a given stream
    - `hipStreamGetAttribute` returns attributes such as priority for a given stream
    - `hipModuleLoadFatBinary`  loads fatbin binary to a module
    - `hipMemcpyBatchAsync` performs a batch of 1D or 2D memory copied asynchronously
    - `hipMemcpy3DBatchAsync` performs a batch of 3D memory copied asynchronously
    - `hipMemcpy3DPeer` copies memory between devices
    - `hipMemcpy3DPeerAsync`copies memory between devices asynchronously
    - `hipMemsetD2D32Async` used for setting 2D memory range with specified 32-bit values
      asynchronously
    - `hipMemPrefetchAsync_v2`  prefetches memory to the specified location
    - `hipMemAdvise_v2`         advise about the usage of a given memory range
    - `hipGetDriverEntryPoint ` gets function pointer of a HIP API.
    - `hipSetValidDevices`      sets a default list of devices that can be used by HIP
    - `hipStreamGetId`          queries the ID of a stream
* Support for the flag `hipMemLocationTypeHost`, enables handling virtual memory management in host memory location, in addition to device memory.
* Support for nested tile partitioning within cooperative groups, matching CUDA functionality.

#### Optimized

* Improved hip module loading latency.
* Optimized kernel metadata retrieval during module post load.
* Optimized doorbell ring in HIP runtime for the following performance improvements:
    - Makes efficient packet batching for HIP graph launch
    - Dynamic packet copying based on a defined maximum threshold or power-of-2 staggered copy pattern
    - If timestamps are not collected for a signal for reuse, it creates a new signal. This can potentially increase the signal footprint if the handler doesn't run fast enough

#### Resolved issues

* A segmentation fault occurred in the application when capturing the same HIP graph from multiple streams with cross-stream dependencies.  The HIP runtime has fixed an issue where a forked stream joined to a parent stream that was not originally created with the API `hipStreamBeginCapture`.
* Different behavior of en-queuing command on a legacy stream during stream capture on AMD ROCM platform, compared with CUDA. HIP runtime now returns an error in this specific situation to match CUDA behavior.
* Failure of memory access fault occurred in rocm-examples test suite. When Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM) is not supported in the driver, `hipMallocManaged` will only allocate system memory in HIP runtime.

#### Known issues

* SPIR-V-enabled applications may encounter an issue of segmentation fault. The problem disappears when SPIR-V is disabled. The issue will be fixed in the next ROCm release. 

### **hipBLAS** (3.1.0)

#### Added

* `--clients-only` build option to only build clients against a prebuilt library.
* gfx1103, gfx1150, gfx1151, gfx1200, and gfx1201 support to clients.
* FORTRAN enabled for the Microsoft Windows build and tests.
* Additional reference library fallback options added.

#### Changed

* Improved the build time for clients by removing `clients_common.cpp` from the hipblas-test build.

### **hipBLASLt** (1.1.0)

#### Added

* Fused Clamp GEMM for ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_EXT`` and ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_BIAS_EXT``. This feature requires the minimum (``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_EPILOGUE_ACT_ARG0_EXT``) and maximum (``HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_EPILOGUE_ACT_ARG1_EXT``) to be set.
* Support for ReLU/Clamp activation functions with auxiliary output for the `FP16` and `BF16` data types for gfx942 to capture intermediate results. This feature is enabled for ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_RELU_AUX``, ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_RELU_AUX_BIAS``, ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_AUX_EXT``, and ``HIPBLASLT_EPILOGUE_CLAMP_AUX_BIAS_EXT``.
* Support for `HIPBLAS_COMPUTE_32F_FAST_16BF` for FP32 data type for gfx950 only.
* CPP extension APIs ``setMaxWorkspaceBytes`` and ``getMaxWorkspaceBytes``.
* Feature to print logs (using ``HIPBLASLT_LOG_MASK=32``) for Grouped GEMM.
* Support for swizzleA by using the hipblaslt-ext cpp API.
* Support for hipBLASLt extop for gfx11xx and gfx12xx.

#### Changed

* ``hipblasLtMatmul()`` now returns an error when the workspace size is insufficient, rather than causing a segmentation fault.

#### Optimized

* `TF32` kernel optimization for the AMD Instinct MI355X GPU to enhance training and inference efficiency.
* Meta Model optimization for the AMD Instinct MI350X GPU to enable better performance across transformer-based models.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed incorrect results when using ldd and ldc dimension parameters with some solutions.

### **hipCUB** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* Exposed Thread-level reduction API `hipcub::ThreadReduce`.
* `::hipcub::extents`, with limited parity to C++23's `std::extents`. Only `static extents` is supported; `dynamic extents` is not. Helper structs have been created to perform computations on `::hipcub::extents` only when the backend is rocPRIM. For the CUDA backend, similar functionality exists.
* `projects/hipcub/hipcub/include/hipcub/backend/rocprim/util_mdspan.hpp` to support `::hipcub::extents`.
* `::hipcub::ForEachInExtents` API.
* `hipcub::DeviceTransform::Transform` and `hipcub::DeviceTransform::TransformStableArgumentAddresses`.
* hipCUB and its dependency rocPRIM have been moved into the new `rocm-libraries` [monorepo repository](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries). This repository contains a number of ROCm libraries that are frequently used together.
  * The repository migration requires a few changes to the way that hipCUB fetches library dependencies.
  * CMake build option `ROCPRIM_FETCH_METHOD` may be set to one of the following:
    * `PACKAGE` - (default) searches for a preinstalled packaged version of the dependency. If it is not found, the build will fall back using option `DOWNLOAD`, below.
    * `DOWNLOAD` - downloads the dependency from the rocm-libraries repository. If git >= 2.25 is present, this option uses a sparse checkout that avoids downloading more than it needs to. If not, the whole monorepo is downloaded (this may take some time).
    * `MONOREPO` - this option is intended to be used if you are building hipCUB from within a copy of the rocm-libraries repository that you have cloned (and therefore already contains rocPRIM). When selected, the build will try find the dependency in the local repository tree. If it cannot be found, the build will attempt to use git to perform a sparse-checkout of rocPRIM. If that also fails, it will fall back to using the `DOWNLOAD` option described above.

* A new CMake option `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIB` to allow tests to be built from installed `hipCUB` provided by the system.

#### Changed

* Changed include headers to avoid relative includes that have slipped in.
* Changed `CUDA_STANDARD` for tests in `test/hipcub`, due to C++17 APIs such as `std::exclusive_scan` is used in some tests. Still use `CUDA_STANDARD 14` for `test/extra`.
* Changed `CCCL_MINIMUM_VERSION` to `2.8.2` to align with CUB.
* Changed `cmake_minimum_required` from `3.16` to `3.18`, in order to support `CUDA_STANDARD 17` as a valid value.
* Add support for large num_items `DeviceScan`, `DevicePartition` and `Reduce::{ArgMin, ArgMax}`.
* Added tests for large num_items.
* The previous dependency-related build option `DEPENDENCIES_FORCE_DOWNLOAD` has been renamed `EXTERNAL_DEPS_FORCE_DOWNLOAD` to differentiate it from the new rocPRIM dependency option described above. Its behavior remains the same - it forces non-ROCm dependencies (Google Benchmark and Google Test) to be downloaded rather than searching for installed packages. This option defaults to `OFF`.

#### Removed

* Removed `TexRefInputIterator`, which was removed from CUB after CCCL's 2.6.0 release. This API should have already been removed, but somehow it remained and was not tested.
* Deprecated `hipcub::ConstantInputIterator`, use `rocprim::constant_iterator` or `rocthrust::constant_iterator` instead.
* Deprecated `hipcub::CountingInputIterator`, use `rocprim::counting_iterator` or `rocthrust::counting_iterator` instead.
* Deprecated `hipcub::DiscardOutputIterator`, use `rocprim::discard_iterator` or `rocthrust::discard_iterator` instead.
* Deprecated `hipcub::TransformInputIterator`, use `rocprim::transform_iterator` or `rocthrust::transform_iterator` instead.
* Deprecated `hipcub::AliasTemporaries`, which is considered to be an internal API. Moved to the detail namespace.
* Deprecated almost all functions in `projects/hipcub/hipcub/include/hipcub/backend/rocprim/util_ptx.hpp`.
* Deprecated hipCUB macros: `HIPCUB_MAX`, `HIPCUB_MIN`, `HIPCUB_QUOTIENT_FLOOR`, `HIPCUB_QUOTIENT_CEILING`, `HIPCUB_ROUND_UP_NEAREST` and `HIPCUB_ROUND_DOWN_NEAREST`.

#### Known issues

* The `__half` template specializations of Simd operators are currently disabled due to possible build issues with PyTorch.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.21)

#### Added

### **hipfort** (0.7.1)

#### Added

* Support for building with CMake 4.0.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed a potential integer overflow issue in `hipMalloc` interfaces.

### **hipRAND** (3.1.0)

#### Resolved issues

* Updated error handling for several hipRAND unit tests to accomodate the new hipGetLastError behaviour that was introduced in ROCm 7.0.0. As of ROCm 7.0.0, the internal error state is cleared on each call to `hipGetLastError` rather than on every HIP API call.

### **hipSOLVER** (3.1.0)

#### Added

    * `hipsparseSpMV` where A and X use bfloat16 and Y and the compute type use float.
    * `hipsparseSpMM` where A and B use bfloat16 and C and the compute type use float.
    * `hipsparseSDDMM` where A and B use bfloat16 and C and the compute type use float.
    * `hipsparseSDDMM` where A and B and C use bfloat16 and the compute type use float.
* Half float mixed precision to `hipsparseSDDMM` where A and B and C use float16 and the compute type use float.
* Brain half float uniform precision to `hipsparseScatter` and `hipsparseGather` routines.
* Documentation for installing and building hipSPARSE on Microsoft Windows.

### **hipSPARSELt** (0.2.5)

#### Changed

  * A workaround has been implemented using max(0, calculated_value) to prevent negative display values while the root cause is under investigation.

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (1.2.0)

#### Added

- ``ROCPROFSYS_ROCM_GROUP_BY_QUEUE`` configuration setting to allow grouping of events by hardware queue, instead of the default grouping.
- Support for `rocpd` database output with the `ROCPROFSYS_USE_ROCPD` configuration setting.
- Support for profiling PyTorch workloads using the `rocpd` output database.
- Support for tracing OpenMP API in Fortran applications.
- An error warning that is triggered if the profiler application fails due to SELinux enforcement being enabled. The warning includes steps to disable SELinux enforcement.

#### Changed

- Updated the grouping of "kernel dispatch" and "memory copy" events in Perfetto traces. They are now grouped together by HIP Stream rather than separately and by hardware queue.
- Updated PAPI module to v7.2.0b2.
- ROCprofiler-SDK is now used for tracing OMPT API calls.

### **rocPRIM** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* `get_sreg_lanemask_lt`, `get_sreg_lanemask_le`, `get_sreg_lanemask_gt` and `get_sreg_lanemask_ge`.
* `rocprim::transform_output_iterator` and `rocprim::make_transform_output_iterator`.
* Experimental support for SPIR-V, to use the correct tuned config for part of the appliable algorithms.
* A new cmake option, `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS`. When rocPRIM is build with this option enabled, the `--offload-compress` switch is passed to the compiler. This causes the compiler to compress the binary that it generates. Compression can be useful in cases where you are compiling for a large number of targets, since this often results in a large binary. Without compression, in some cases, the generated binary may become so large symbols are placed out of range, resulting in linking errors. The new `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` option is set to `ON` by default.
* A new CMake option `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIB` to allow tests to be built from `ROCm` libraries provided by the system.
* `rocprim::apply` which applies a function to a `rocprim::tuple`.

#### Changed

* Changed tests to support `ptr-to-const` output in `/test/rocprim/test_device_batch_memcpy.cpp`.

#### Optimized

* Improved performance of many algorithms by updating their tuned configs.
  * 891 specializations have been improved.
  * 399 specializations have been added.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed `device_select`, `device_merge`, and `device_merge_sort` not allocating the correct amount of virtual shared memory on the host.
* Fixed the `-&gt;` operator for the `transform_iterator`, the `texture_cache_iterator`, and the `arg_index_iterator`, by now returning a proxy pointer.
  * The `arg_index_iterator` also now only returns the internal iterator for the `-&gt;`.

#### Upcoming changes

* Deprecated the `-&gt;` operator for the `zip_iterator`.

### **ROCProfiler** (2.0.0)

#### Removed

* `rocprofv2` doesn't support gfx12xx Series GPUs. For gfx12xx Series GPUs, use `rocprofv3` tool.

### **ROCprofiler-SDK** (1.0.0)

#### Added
* Dynamic process attachment- ROCprofiler-SDK and `rocprofv3` now facilitate dynamic profiling of a running GPU applications by attaching to its process ID (PID), rather than launching the application through the profiler itself.
* Scratch-memory trace information to the Perfetto output in `rocprofv3`.
* New capabilities to the thread trace support in `rocprofv3`:
    * Real-time clock support for thread trace alignment on gfx9 architecture. This enables high-resolution clock computation and better synchronization across shader engines. 
    * `MultiKernelDispatch` thread trace support is now available across all ASICs.
* Documentation for dynamic process attachment.
* Documentation for `rocpd` summaries.

#### Optimized
* Improved the stability and robustness of the `rocpd` output.

### **rocPyDecode** (0.7.0)

#### Added
* rocPyJpegPerfSample - samples for JPEG decode

#### Changed
* Package - rocjpeg set as required dependency.
* rocDecode host - rocdecode host linking updates

#### Resolved issues
* rocJPEG Bindings - bugfixes
* Test package - find dependencies updated

### **rocRAND** (4.1.0)

#### Changed

* Changed the `USE_DEVICE_DISPATCH` flag so it can turn device dispatch off by setting it to zero. Device dispatch should be turned off when building for SPIRV.

#### Resolved issues

* Updated error handling for several rocRAND unit tests to accommodate the new `hipGetLastError` behavior that was introduced in ROCm 7.0.
As of ROCm 7.0, the internal error state is cleared on each call to `hipGetLastError` rather than on every HIP API call.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.30.0)

#### Added

* Hybrid computation support for existing routines: STEQR

#### Optimized

Improved the performance of:

* BDSQR and downstream functions such as GESVD.
* STEQR and downstream functions such as SYEV/HEEV.
* LARFT and downstream functions such as GEQR2 and GEQRF.

### **rocSPARSE** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* Brain half float mixed precision for the following routines:
   * `rocsparse_axpby` where X and Y use bfloat16 and result and the compute type use float.
   * `rocsparse_spvv` where X and Y use bfloat16 and result and the compute type use float.
   * `rocsparse_spmv` where A and X use bfloat16 and Y and the compute type use float.
   * `rocsparse_spmm` where A and B use bfloat16 and C and the compute type use float.
   * `rocsparse_sddmm` where A and B use bfloat16 and C and the compute type use float.
   * `rocsparse_sddmm` where A and B and C use bfloat16 and the compute type use float.
* Half float mixed precision to `rocsparse_sddmm` where A and B and C use float16 and the compute type use float.
* Brain half float uniform precision to `rocsparse_scatter` and `rocsparse_gather` routines.

#### Optimized

* Improved the user documentation.

#### Upcoming changes

* Deprecate trace, debug, and bench logging using the environment variable `ROCSPARSE_LAYER`.

### **rocThrust** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* A new CMake option `-DSQLITE_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE` to allow SQLite to be provided by the system.
* Introduced `libhipcxx` as a soft dependency. When `liphipcxx` can be included, rocThrust can use structs and methods defined in `libhipcxx`. This allows for a more complete behavior parity with CCCL and mirrors CCCL's thrust own dependency on `libcudacxx`.
* Added a new CMake option `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIB` to allow tests to be built from `ROCm` libraries provided by the system.

#### Changed

* The previously hidden cmake build option `FORCE_DEPENDENCIES_DOWNLOAD` has been unhidden and renamed `EXTERNAL_DEPS_FORCE_DOWNLOAD` to differentiate it from the new rocPRIM and rocRAND dependency options described above. Its behavior remains the same - it forces non-ROCm dependencies (Google Benchmark, Google Test, and SQLite) to be downloaded instead of searching for existing installed packages. This option defaults to `OFF`.

#### Removed

* The previous dependency-related build options `DOWNLOAD_ROCPRIM` and `DOWNLOAD_ROCRAND` have been removed. Use `ROCPRIM_FETCH_METHOD=DOWNLOAD` and `ROCRAND_FETCH_METHOD=DOWNLOAD` instead.

#### Known issues

* `event` test is failing on CI and local runs on MI300, MI250 and MI210.

* rocThrust, as well as its dependencies rocPRIM and rocRAND have been moved into the new `rocm-libraries` monorepo repository (https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries). This repository contains a number of ROCm libraries that are frequently used together.
  * The repository migration requires a few changes to the way that rocThrust's ROCm library dependencies are fetched.
  * There are new cmake options for obtaining rocPRIM and (optionally, if BUILD_BENCHMARKS is enabled) rocRAND.
  * cmake build options `ROCPRIM_FETCH_METHOD` and `ROCRAND_FETCH_METHOD` may be set to one of the following:
    * `PACKAGE` - (default) searches for a preinstalled packaged version of the dependency. If it is not found, the build will fall back using option `DOWNLOAD`, described below.
    * `DOWNLOAD` - downloads the dependency from the rocm-libraries repository. If git >= 2.25 is present, this option uses a sparse checkout that avoids downloading more than it needs to. If not, the whole monorepo is downloaded (this may take some time).
    * `MONOREPO` - this option is intended to be used if you are building rocThrust from within a copy of the rocm-libraries repository that you have cloned (and therefore already contains the dependencies rocPRIM and rocRAND). When selected, the build will try to find the dependency in the local repository tree. If it cannot be found, the build will attempt to add it to the local tree using a sparse-checkout. If that also fails, it will fall back to using the `DOWNLOAD` option.

### **RPP** (2.1.0)

#### Added

* Solarize augmentation for HOST and HIP.
* Hue and Saturation adjustment augmentations for HOST and HIP.
* Find RPP - cmake module.
* Posterize augmentation for HOST and HIP.

#### Changed

* HALF - Fix `half.hpp` path updates.
* Box filter - padding updates.

#### Removed

* Packaging - Removed Meta Package dependency for HIP.
* SLES 15 SP6 support.

#### Resolved issues

* Test Suite - Fixes for accuracy.
* HIP Backend - Check return status warning fixes.
* Bugfix - HIP vector types init.

## ROCm known issues

ROCm known issues are noted on {fab}`github` [GitHub](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/labels/Verified%20Issue). For known
issues related to individual components, review the [Detailed component changes](#detailed-component-changes).

### MIGraphX Python API will fail when running on Python 3.13

Applications using the MIGraphX Python API will fail when running on Python 3.13 and return the error message `AttributeError: module 'migraphx' has no attribute 'parse_onnx'`. The issue does not occur when you manually build MIGraphX. For detailed instructions, see [Building from source](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/AMDMIGraphX/en/latest/install/building_migraphx.html). As a workaround, change the Python version to the one found in the installed location:

```
ls -l /opt/rocm-7.0.0/lib/libmigraphx_py_*.so
```
The issue will be resolved in a future ROCm release. See [GitHub issue #5500](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/5500).

## ROCm resolved issues

The following are previously known issues resolved in this release. For resolved issues related to
individual components, review the [Detailed component changes](#detailed-component-changes).

### Segmentation fault in ROCprofiler-SDK due to ABI mismatch affecting std::regex

An issue of segmentation fault in ROCprofiler-SDK that uses `std::regex` has been resolved. Starting with GCC 5.1, GNU `libstdc++` introduced a dual Application Binary Interface (ABI) to adopt `C++11`, primarily affecting the `std::string` and its dependencies, including `std::regex`. The issue occured if your code was compiled against headers expecting one ABI but linked or run with the other, resulting problems with `std::string` and `std::regex`. See [GitHub issue #5343](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/5343).

### Clang compilation failure might occur due to incorrectly installed GNU C++ runtime

An issue of Clang compilation failing with the error `fatal error: 'cmath' file not found` if the GNU C++ runtime was not installed correctly has been resolved. The error indicated that the `libstdc++-dev` package, compatible with the latest installed GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version, was missing. This issue was a result of Clang being unable to find the newest GNU C++ runtimes it recognizes and the associated header files. See [GitHub issue #4612](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4612).

## ROCm upcoming changes

The following changes to the ROCm software stack are anticipated for future releases.

### ROCm SMI deprecation

[ROCm SMI](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib) will be phased out in an
upcoming ROCm release and will enter maintenance mode. After this transition,
only critical bug fixes will be addressed and no further feature development
will take place.
 
It's strongly recommended to transition your projects to [AMD
SMI](https://github.com/ROCm/amdsmi), the successor to ROCm SMI. AMD SMI
includes all the features of the ROCm SMI and will continue to receive regular
updates, new functionality, and ongoing support. For more information on AMD
SMI, see the [AMD SMI documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/amdsmi/en/latest/).

### ROCTracer, ROCProfiler, rocprof, and rocprofv2 deprecation

Development and support for ROCTracer, ROCProfiler, `rocprof`, and `rocprofv2` are being phased out in favor of ROCprofiler-SDK in upcoming ROCm releases. Starting with ROCm 6.4, only critical defect fixes will be addressed for older versions of the profiling tools and libraries. All users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of the ROCprofiler-SDK library and the (`rocprofv3`) tool to ensure continued support and access to new features. ROCprofiler-SDK is still in beta today and will be production-ready in a future ROCm release.
 
It's anticipated that ROCTracer, ROCProfiler, `rocprof`, and `rocprofv2` will reach end-of-life by future releases, aligning with Q1 of 2026.

### AMDGPU wavefront size compiler macro deprecation

Access to the wavefront size as a compile-time constant via the `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE`
and `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE__` macros are deprecated and will be disabled in a future release. In ROCm 7.0.0 `warpSize` is only available as a non-`constexpr` variable. You're encouraged to update your code if needed to ensure future compatibility.

* The `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE__` macro and `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE` alias will be removed in an upcoming release.
  It is recommended to remove any use of this macro. For more information, see
  [AMDGPU support](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/llvm-project/en/docs-7.0.2/LLVM/clang/html/AMDGPUSupport.html).
* `warpSize` is only available as a non-`constexpr` variable. Where required,
  the wavefront size should be queried via the `warpSize` variable in device code,
  or via `hipGetDeviceProperties` in host code. Neither of these will result in a compile-time constant. For more information, see [warpSize](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/docs-7.0.2/how-to/hip_cpp_language_extensions.html#warpsize).
* For cases where compile-time evaluation of the wavefront size cannot be avoided,
  uses of `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE`, `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE__`, or `warpSize`
  can be replaced with a user-defined macro or `constexpr` variable with the wavefront
  size(s) for the target hardware. For example: 

```
   #if defined(__GFX9__)
   #define MY_MACRO_FOR_WAVEFRONT_SIZE 64
   #else
   #define MY_MACRO_FOR_WAVEFRONT_SIZE 32
   #endif
```

### Changes to ROCm Object Tooling

ROCm Object Tooling tools ``roc-obj-ls``, ``roc-obj-extract``, and ``roc-obj`` were
deprecated in ROCm 6.4, and will be removed in a future release. Functionality
has been added to the ``llvm-objdump --offloading`` tool option to extract all
clang-offload-bundles into individual code objects found within the objects
or executables passed as input.  The ``llvm-objdump --offloading`` tool option also
supports the ``--arch-name`` option, and only extracts code objects found with
the specified target architecture. See [llvm-objdump](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-objdump.html)
for more information.
